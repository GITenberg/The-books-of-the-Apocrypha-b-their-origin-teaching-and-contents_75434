<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Signs have not been wanting during the last few years
of an increasing interest both in what is called the
“Apocrypha” as well as in the body of literature, mainly
of an apocalyptic character, which goes under the name of
the “Pseudepigrapha.”</p>

<p>Notable among these signs are two of an outstanding
character. The founding of the “International Society for
the Promoting of the Study of the Apocrypha” was an
important event in this connection; the founder, the Rev.
Herbert Pentin, is to be sincerely congratulated on the
success with which his efforts have been crowned; the
support accorded by many of our leading scholars has doubtless
been very gratifying to him. Few things have done
more to foster interest in the subjects which the Society
has at heart than the publication of its quarterly journal,
<cite>The International Journal of Apocrypha</cite>. This magazine
makes its appeal to all grades of readers; and if the greater
stress is laid upon the popular side, the editor has his good
reasons for this, for it is the general reader who does not
yet understand that the “Apocrypha” and the “Pseudepigrapha”
together form an indispensable link between the
Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>The second outstanding sign was the publication last
year by the Oxford University Press of the two sumptuous
volumes entitled <cite>The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old
Testament in English</cite>, with introductions and critical and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
explanatory notes to the several books, edited, in conjunction
with many scholars, by R. H. Charles, Litt.D., D.D. This
is the most elaborate thing of the kind ever published in
any country, and the debt to Canon Charles owed by all
lovers of learning is great indeed. The volumes appeal
primarily to the scholar, though the general reader will find
in them a very great deal which he will be able to appreciate.
The drawback, for most people, is their expense,
obviously inevitable; it is, therefore, the more to be regretted
that the University Press could not see its way to
publish the various books in separate, as well as in their
collective, form.</p>

<p>Signs such as these are full of promise, and the growing
interest which they betoken is very welcome.</p>

<p>The present writer, as one of the Wardens of the afore-mentioned
Society, and as one of Canon Charles’ fellow-labourers
in the work just referred to, has been emboldened
to write the following pages with the object of pressing
home the importance of one department of the subject as a
whole (though without wholly losing sight of the other),
viz., the “Apocrypha,” and, more especially, what is involved
by the study of this. The very unfortunate title
which has clung to this body of literature since the
days of St. Jerome, largely accounts for the attitude of
suspicion with which it is often regarded; but when once
it is realized that the term “Apocrypha,” as applied to
these books, does not correspond to what is nowadays
understood by the word “apocryphal,” this attitude of
suspicion will disappear.</p>

<p>The study of these books opens up various questions
which demand consideration; so much so, that the student
soon comes to realize that important as the study of the
Apocrypha is, more important still is that which this study
involves. The book here presented is intended to illustrate
this; with the result that Part I (“Prolegomena”) occupies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
considerably more space than Part II, which is devoted to
the books of the Apocrypha themselves. There is, however,
no reason to offer any apology for this, as the Introductory
Note to the “Prolegomena” will show.</p>

<p>For the rest, the book, though primarily intended for
the intelligent general reader, may in some parts, it is
hoped, be of interest to scholars. It was originally intended
to be a contribution to “The Library of Historic Theology”;
but the writer soon realized that the scope of the subject
would necessitate a larger volume than the publishers
thought desirable for this Series; they, therefore, decided
to publish it separately.</p>

<p>The writer desires to express his sincere thanks to the
Rev. Wm. C. Piercy for having read carefully through the
book in manuscript as well as in proof, and for having offered
many valuable suggestions.</p>

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="PI_Introductory">Introductory</h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The book here presented is divided into two parts:
the first, which is somewhat longer than the second,
deals with preliminary questions; the second is occupied
with some account of the nature and contents of the books
comprised under the term “Apocrypha.” To those whose
studies have not been concerned with early Jewish uncanonical
literature it may appear that many of the subjects
discussed in Part I are inappropriate, or at any rate unnecessary,
because they lead, apparently, far away from the
main subject to be dealt with. Students of the Apocrypha
will know, however, that a really intelligent and adequate
study of this body of ancient literature necessitates research
into a number of topics which do not at first sight appear
to show a direct connexion with the main subject. Nevertheless,
for the benefit of those who have not made a study
of the Apocrypha, it may be well to justify at the outset
the incursion into the many side-issues dealt with in the
“Prolegomena” (Part I) by showing that the consideration
of them is really indispensable for a proper understanding
of the Apocrypha, its origin, and its <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i>.</p>

<p>Now one of the first things that must strike any intelligent
reader of the books of the Apocrypha is the extraordinary
variety of their contents. We have in the First Book of
Maccabees genuine historical records of the highest value;
in the Second Book of Maccabees, on the other hand, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
have a mixture of history and fiction. In the First (or
Third) Book of Esdras we get portions of the canonical
Scriptures side by side with records from other sources;
and, strange to say, the latter are probably in some particulars
more trustworthy than the corresponding portions in
the former. In The Rest of Esther and the Prayer of
Manasses we have additions to books of the canonical
Scriptures which are edifying, though largely the work of
the imagination; while in the additions to the Book of
Daniel, namely, The Song of the Three Holy Children,
The History of Susannah, and Bel and the Dragon, we have
examples of fiction which are not always edifying. Of
an entirely different character is the fascinating story of
a brave and patriotic woman, told in the Book of Judith,
in which the writer’s power of dramatic narrative is well
exhibited. Interesting from other points of view is the
homely tale told in the Book of Tobit, with its developed
angelology and quaint demonology. But what is in many
respects the most important book in the whole collection
is that fine example of the Palestinian Wisdom Literature,
the Wisdom of Ben-Sira (Ecclesiasticus), which, apart
from its subject proper, gives us much interesting information
regarding the conditions of Jewish life and manners
during a period of which we have otherwise but meagre
sources of knowledge. Baruch, again, is valuable as containing
a liturgical piece of considerable antiquity. Very
important, too, and of great interest, is that striking product
of Hellenistic-Jewish wisdom, The Wisdom of Solomon,
as it is called; this book offers an illustration of the profound
influence which the Greek spirit had upon the Jews of
the Dispersion. And, lastly, we have what is in some respects
one of the finest books belonging to the Apocalyptic Literature
ii. (iv.) Esdras, revealing as it does in a wonderful
way the moral and religious speculations of an earnest mind
seeking after the truth, and claiming to have received revelations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
by supernatural means. Scripture, history, legend,
fiction, at least one liturgical piece, wisdom, philosophy,
apocalypse—truly it is an extraordinary variety of subjects
which is here presented.</p>

<p>But further; when one looks more closely one sees that
in these books various thought-tendencies and mental
attitudes are represented—political, intellectual, doctrinal,
religious; so that questions arise, and demand consideration,
as to who the men were among whom these thought-tendencies
existed, what it was that first gave rise to them,
what the relation was between those who belonged to the
different schools of thought represented, and other questions
of a similar character. The intelligent reader will want
to know, on the one hand, what is reflected in these books
concerning such questions, and, on the other, what light
they themselves shed on the history of thought and religion
during the period, extending over about three hundred
years, at which they were written.</p>

<p>Of a different character, but very much to the point, is the
inquiry into the position held by these books in the sacred
literature of the Jews. They are not assigned a place in
the canonical Hebrew Scriptures, but they are found in
the Greek Old Testament, which was the Bible used by the
New Testament writers and by the Early Church. Who
excluded them from the canonical list, and on what grounds
were they excluded? What was their position before the
Canon was formed, and when was the Canon formed?
What is meant by the title “Apocrypha,” by whom was
the title given, and when?</p>

<p>These are some of the many questions which suggest
themselves to the serious student of the Apocrypha; and
a moment’s thought will show that adequate answers to
them are required if the contents of the Apocrypha, and all
that they imply, are to be properly understood.</p>

<p>The purpose of the “Prolegomena” is to try and give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
answers to these and many other questions which arise as
soon as the study of this body of ancient Jewish sacred
literature is undertaken.</p>

<p>The first chapter deals with the Hellenistic Movement.
Some consideration of the way in which the Greek spirit
influenced the world in general, from the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
onwards, is altogether necessary because there was no
department of life in which the effects of this influence
were not to be discerned. For our present purpose the
way in which Hellenism affected religious thought is, of
course, an exceedingly important subject for consideration.
Now the Hellenistic Movement synchronized with the
entire period during which the “Apocryphal” Literature
was produced. It commenced as a result of the conquests
of Alexander the Great, and extended well into the times
of the Empire; within that period were written the earliest
and the latest of the books of the Apocrypha, viz., The
Wisdom of Ben-Sira, about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 170, and The Apocalypse
of Ezra, about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 100. The Hellenistic Movement was
thus, as it were, the intellectual and religious atmosphere
of the world during the whole of the period in which the
writers of the books of the Apocrypha lived. No apology
is needed, therefore, for beginning our study with a brief
consideration of the Hellenistic Movement.</p>

<p>Since, like other great movements, this one was a vital
process which affected the whole world, the Jews, as just
hinted, came under its sway. We have, therefore, devoted
two chapters to Hellenistic influence upon the Jews. The
extent and effect of this influence upon the Jews of Palestine
was not the same as upon the Jews of the Dispersion, so
that this part of our subject has to be dealt with under two
heads. In discussing the former we touch upon a factor
in the discussion which will come before us again and again
as we proceed, namely, the Jews as the people of the Law.
We referred just now to various schools of thought of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
indications are to be seen in the books of the Apocrypha;
the most important of these was that which looked upon
the Law and its observances as that which should occupy
the thoughts and actions of every true Jew, and to which
everything else should be subordinated. It was the championship
of the Law which checked, and ultimately stamped
out, Hellenistic influence upon the Jews of Palestine, though
not until that influence had so permeated their minds that
some of its elements became incorporated into orthodox
Judaism. As will be seen later, these facts help to explain
much that is written in the books of the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>But distinct as the marks were which the influence of
Hellenism left upon the Jews of Palestine and upon some
of their literature, that influence was far less upon them than
upon the Jews of the Dispersion. In dealing with this
part of our subject a preliminary section is devoted to some
account of the Dispersion, special reference being made
to Alexandria, the most important centre of the Dispersion.
The most notable and far-reaching result of Hellenistic
influence here is to be seen in the fact that it was the birthplace
of the Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament; since
it is in this Version of the Scriptures that the books of the
Apocrypha were incorporated, it stands to reason that
some account of it is necessary. While the Septuagint
was the most striking literary product of the Hellenistic
Movement in the Dispersion, Philo of Alexandria was its
most notable personality; a section devoted to him can,
therefore, not be out of place.</p>

<p>It was pointed out above that Hellenistic influence was
to be discerned in the sacred literature of the Jews. This
is a subject upon which differences of opinion exist, especially
in regard to some of the later books of the Old Testament;
but it cannot well be ignored in dealing with the
books of the Apocrypha, so that in <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a> we examine
the question of traces of Greek influence in the Old Testament
and in the Apocrypha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Further, we have referred to the fact that in the Apocrypha
signs of the existence of various thought-tendencies
are to be discerned; the attitude of extreme loyalty to the
Law was one of these; another was represented by the
Apocalyptic Movement. Quite apart from the fact that
we have in The Apocalypse of Ezra a remarkable product
of the Apocalyptic Movement, which would of itself
be sufficient to demand some account of this movement
here, there is the further fact that some insight into the
religious movements of a period is indispensable to the
true understanding of any body of literature belonging
to such period. It is for this reason that we have devoted
a chapter to the consideration of the Apocalyptic Movement
and to a brief survey of the doctrinal teaching of
the Apocalyptic Literature; it will be found to be of real
interest if the general results of the doctrinal teaching of
this literature be compared with that of the books of the
Apocrypha, which is more fully dealt with in the last
chapter (XII) of the “Prolegomena.”</p>

<p>The thought-tendencies to which reference has been
made, and each of which has been embodied in literary
form, have a history behind them, dating at least from
the time of Ezra; how these developed in Palestine during
the four centuries which preceded the advent of Christ is
a difficult and intricate, but none the less fascinating,
study, and altogether indispensable alike for the understanding
of the Apocrypha and of the New Testament.
Scribes of different kinds, <i>Chassidim</i>, Apocalyptists, Pharisees
and Sadducees, how did they come into being? What
were their different special mental and religious attitudes?
What was their relationship to each other? There are
intricate problems involved in such questions, and the
study of the Apocrypha brings us face to face with them;
that sufficiently explains the reason why <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_V">Chapters V</a>-VII
are devoted to the discussion of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>With <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_VIII">Chapters VIII</a>-X we approach an entirely different
side of our subject, namely, the question of the Canon and
of uncanonical books generally; this is, of course, of fundamental
importance for the study of the Apocrypha, so
that no explanation is needed for the reason of these three
chapters figuring in the “Prolegomena.” The same is also
true of <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>, which deals with the Wisdom Literature,
for not only have we two remarkable examples of this
literature in the Apocrypha, but it is a literature which,
while it begins in the Old Testament, is continued in the
Apocrypha, so that it must be treated as a whole; the
question of canonical or uncanonical books must not be
allowed to interfere here.</p>

<p>The last chapter <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_XII">(XII)</a>, on the doctrinal teaching of the
Apocrypha, requires no further words here other than to
say that the study of this subject is very necessary for
following out the development of doctrine from the Old
Testament to the New.</p>

<p>This, then, is the explanation and justification for the
many discussions in the “Prolegomena” which seem at
first sight to lead far away from the main subject in hand.
These have, it is true, an interest and an application far
beyond that of their relation to the Apocrypha, but that,
it may safely be assumed, will not be regarded as a drawback,
or as a reason for making the discussion of them here
unnecessary.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">To offer in any detail an account of such an immense
subject as the Hellenistic Movement would be out
of the question here; but no study which has to do with
Jewish religion or culture of the three last pre-Christian
centuries can be taken in hand without some reference to
the Movement which so profoundly affected the world of
those times. The object of the present chapter is, therefore,
to indicate the main directions in which Hellenistic
influence was exercised; so much is essential when it is
remembered that the books of the Apocrypha form an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
integral part of the Greek Old Testament, which is itself
one of the most striking products of the Hellenistic Movement
in the domain of literature.</p>

<p>A word must be said at the outset regarding the use of
the terms <em>Hellenic</em> and <em>Hellenistic</em>. It is not always easy
to be strictly logical or consistent in the way in which one
employs these; the fundamental difference between the two
is this: <em>Hellenic culture</em> refers, of course, to the pure Greek
civilization, religion, etc., existing previous to the coming
of Alexander the Great; <em>Hellenistic culture</em> refers to this
civilization as it appeared after having absorbed numerous
elements in the domain both of thought and religion from
non-Greek sources after the coming of Alexander the Great.
Hellenistic culture exercised a greater and wider influence
upon the world than Hellenic, because by absorbing alien
elements it was able to become a world-culture. The terms
have thus a distinct and clearly defined difference. But
inasmuch as Hellenistic culture is based upon and has as its
chief characteristic Hellenic culture, it is sometimes convenient
to use the terms Hellenism and Hellenic in a wide
and inclusive sense; as so used it is equivalent to the term
<em>Greek</em>, without restriction to any particular age.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHI_I">I. <span class="smcap">Hellenism in its Secular Aspect</span></h4>

<p>By the Hellenistic Movement is meant the process whereby
the supremacy of the Greek language and of Greek culture
generally became established during the period, roughly
speaking, from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300 to the beginning of the Christian
era, that is to say, from the time when Alexander the Great
had completed his victorious career<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to the time when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Roman Empire was rising to pre-eminence and establishing
its power, more especially in the east. It was during this
period that Hellenism was what may be called an invading
force; having once established itself its influence was in
evidence long after the period indicated. Dill, in writing
on the age of Hadrian and the Antonines, says, for example:
“The glory of classic art had almost vanished; and yet,
without being able to produce any works of creative genius,
the inexhaustible vitality of the Hellenic spirit once more
asserted itself. After a long eclipse, the rhetorical culture
of Greece vigorously addressed itself in the reign of Hadrian
to the conquest of the west. Her teachers and spiritual
directors, indeed, had long been in every family of note.
Her sophists were now seen haranguing crowds in every
town from the Don to the Atlantic.... From the early
years of the second century can be traced that great combined
movement of the Neo-Pythagorean and Platonist
philosophies and the renovated paganism which made a
last stand against the conquering Church in the reigns of
Julian and Theodosius....”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But the influence of Hellenism did not stop here; various
writers have shown that that influence persists even up
to modern times,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Bevan states nothing but the literal
truth when he says that “what we call the Western spirit
in our own day is really Hellenism reincarnate.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is well to realize, on the other hand, however, that
the roots of the Hellenistic Movement reached back somewhat
further than the time of Alexander. We must look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to Athens for the real beginnings of the Movement, the
further development of which Alexander’s conquests did
so much to forward. It was the Attic sea-power which
first brought about the conditions under which the idea
of a pan-Hellenic culture could take form and ultimately
become realized. Though Athens declined with the rise
of the Macedonian power, and ceased outwardly to play
any conspicuous part in the great drama of the world’s
history, yet Attic ideals and conceptions lived on and continued
to be the inner motive-power in the propagation
of the newer culture. So that the Hellenistic Movement
grew and developed from Attic antecedents.</p>

<p>Then, again, although the rise of the Hellenistic Movement
is rightly associated more particularly with the name of
Alexander, it is but simple justice which compels us to recall
the fact that the Macedonian empire, which formed the
basis of Alexander’s future world-power, owed its creation
to his father, Philip (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 359-336). It was only through
strenuous struggles with Thracians, Illyrians and Athenians
that Philip finally consolidated his kingdom, and thus made
the necessary preparations for his son’s greater work. The
decisive battle of Chæronea, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 338, when Philip defeated
the allied forces of Athens and Thebes, may legitimately
be pointed to as one of the preliminary determining factors
which prepared the way for the Hellenistic Movement.</p>

<p>In the first instance the influence of the newer Hellenism
was, of course, exercised by means of the Greek language.
But it was a form of Greek which differed in many respects
from the older Attic Greek, though based on this; it is
now known by the name of Hellenistic Greek. “It was
the literary language of the cosmopolitan Hellas, created
by the genius of Alexander. The change [i.e., from Attic
Greek] had begun indeed before Alexander. Even Xenophon
allows himself to make free use of words of provincial
origin, and to employ Attic words with a new connotation;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and the writings of Aristotle mark the opening of a new
era in the history of the Greek language.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The discovery
and study of immense numbers of Greek <i>papyri</i> and <i>ostraka</i>
(potsherds) has shown the fallacy, universally prevalent a
generation ago, of speaking of “Biblical Greek,” i.e., the
Greek of the Septuagint and of the New Testament, as
though it were a form of Greek peculiar to the Bible, to
be separated off from “profane” Greek. The Septuagint
and the New Testament were written in a late form of
Greek, i.e., Hellenistic Greek which, as we have just seen,
came into vogue during the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and onwards.
This late Greek, including the Greek of the Bible
is, in the words of Deissmann, “neither good nor bad;
it bears the stamp of its age and asserts its own distinctive
position in a gradual process of development in the language,
which, beginning in the earliest times, has lasted down to
the present day. Late Greek has stripped off much that
was customary in the earlier period, and it contains germs
of future developments destined to be completed in modern
Greek. We may, then, speak of a certain peculiarity and
uniformity in original ‘Bible’ Greek, but solely as opposed
to earlier or later phases of the history of the language, not
as opposed to ‘profane’ Greek.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It was through the conquests of Alexander that the ways
were made clear and wide for this later form of the Greek
language, this Hellenistic Greek, to find an opening in all
directions, and to be employed as a common means of
communication in ever-increasing measure. Close upon
the soldiers followed the merchants, nor did it take long
before colonists came and settled down in the newly conquered
territories; and when once colonies of Greek-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
people were established, teachers soon came and took
up their abode in the new settlements. New Greek cities
thus arose in which practically only Greek was spoken;
with the employment of this language it followed in a
natural course that the influence of the Greek spirit, and
with it Greek forms of thought and Greek ideals, made itself
felt. In this way Alexander’s ambition was attained; for
his ideal was not only to conquer lands; he desired also
that the hearts and minds of men should be brought under
the domination of that Greek culture which was destined
to affect the religion, the philosophy, the literature and
the art of mankind for all time. Alexander was a worthy
pupil of his great teacher, Aristotle.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not always sufficiently realized that the
Hellenistic Movement coincided to a large extent with an
epoch which was in some notable respects one of dissolution.
In the domain of learning, for example, the older Greek
idea of the possibility of a single mind assimilating the
whole content of knowledge had been discarded; for it
had come to be seen that the sum of knowledge in its manifold
ramifications was far too great to be acquired by any
one man, however learned, and that specialists must devote
themselves to different departments of learning. Hence
arose the grammarian as well as the rhetorician, the historian
as well as the mathematician, while the philosopher occupied
his special position.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The scholar, therefore, who desired
to gain some insight into more than one of the various
branches of knowledge no longer went, as in earlier days,
to one teacher who was supposed to possess encyclopædic
learning, but he studied under a grammarian in order to
learn grammar, under a rhetorician in order to learn rhetoric,
under a philosopher in order to learn philosophy, and so on.
This newer system had already forced itself to the front
some time before the actual period with which we are dealing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
there are clear indications in the methods and teaching of
Plato, to say nothing of Aristotle and his pupils, of an increasing
tendency of making wider differentiation between
the various sciences, and of dividing them up into their
various groups. Philosophy stands alone; the exact
sciences go each along the line of their own development.
What was thus prepared by these great philosophers and
their followers was acted upon and greatly developed during
the Hellenistic period proper. Nowhere was this more the
case than in Alexandria, the city of Alexander’s founding.
It was in Alexandria that during the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
the exact sciences reached the height of their development.
All that was acquired through the incentive given later
by the study of the exact sciences of antiquity during the
Middle Ages through the medium of Arabic translations,
and during the <i lang="fr">Renaissance</i> by means of newly discovered
Greek originals of the ancient classics, was in the main due
to the achievements wrought during this epoch.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> That
Alexandria should have been, during the Hellenistic period,
the centre of this intensive, intellectual activity will be
seen to have been a fact of great importance when we come
to speak of this city as having been also the centre of the
Jewish Dispersion.</p>

<p>Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was, however, but the greatest example of
many other new cities founded by Alexander, or through
his inspiration, while a far greater number which were already
in existence were hellenized through his instrumentality.
With regard to these latter a fact of great importance must
be noted; one effect of the entry of Hellenistic influence
into the civic life of the “barbarians” was that the Greek
came to know and understand his fellow-creatures of other
nationalities; he saw that those whom he had always been
taught to despise as not much better than semi-civilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
savages, also had their forms of culture which likewise
boasted of a hoary antiquity. The Greeks were, therefore,
led to study the methods of thought, the customs and the
beliefs of these “barbarians,” with the result that contempt
was turned to admiration, and the Greeks came to regard
the “barbarians” as brothers. Cynic and Stoic philosophers,
“the Rousseaus of Hellenism” as Krüger very happily
calls them, spoke of and taught a brotherhood of man, a new
and wonderful thing; and a cosmopolitanism, hitherto
unheard of, came into being.</p>

<p>But if the mingling together of Greek and “barbarian”
was the means of creating a cosmopolitanism, in the best
sense, no less characteristic of the Hellenistic period is the
fact that the importance of the individual came to be recognized.
The Hellenization of “barbarian” cities, referred
to just now, meant that these attained to a state of semi-independence;
in all cases of this kind the local government
of the city was framed on the Greek model; the part which
the people took in the political assemblies and in the annual
elections had the natural effect of making them feel that
they had a real interest and a definite part to play in the
administration of affairs. It is easy to understand how
the result of this was the emphasizing of the importance of
each individual. Where the individual, while claiming
and exercising his rights of citizenship, does not lose sight
of his responsibilities, an ideal combination is offered. This
individualism of the true and genuine type the Greeks gave
to the world; it is an example of the sense of proportion
which was a peculiarly Hellenic <em>trait</em>. During the Hellenistic
period, therefore, individualism came to its own.</p>

<p>Not unconnected with this subject of individualism was
the philosophical teaching of the Hellenistic period. The
main interest in the philosophical systems of this time
centred in ethics; and ethical teaching concerns the individual
first and foremost. It was the ethical system of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the Stoics<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to which was primarily due the emphasis laid
on the conception of law and duty; virtue is the only good,
they taught, vice the only evil; all else is indifferent. Moreover,
Hellenistic philosophy set before men the ideal of
wisdom; the highest attainment for mortals, so it was
taught, was that they should become wise men. It was
a noble picture that was depicted, even though the Stoic
ideal was unattainable, of the free and independent and self-reliant
individual who, through the wisdom that he has
acquired, stands towering above his fellows, though not
in aloofness, but as a helper. It has been pointed out with
justice that it is the stress laid on the importance of the
individual which largely accounts for the numerous striking
personalities, both men and women, who come before us
during the Hellenistic period. The historian Polybius (born
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 204) was the first to recognize the importance
of the individual as a factor in the course and development
of history. It is during this period especially that great
individuals appear as the pivots of history. Now, too, for
the first time, biography becomes a science; delineation
of character, the motives of individual action, and psychological
analysis of the heart and mind are now regarded
as indispensable for the proper understanding of men and
their doings.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Whether in politics, or science, or philosophy, or literature,
or in estimating their fellow-creatures, the Greeks offer a
remarkable example of the determination to see men and
things in the world around them as they really are; their
instinctive critical faculty made them <em>realists</em>. Nothing
must be taken for granted, all things must be tested by the
light of reason; only so can the reality of things be ascertained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
“The critical faculty, the reason—in one light it
appears as the <em>sense of proportion</em>; the sense of proportion
in politics, ‘common sense,’ balance of judgement; the
sense of proportion in behaviour, which distinguishes what
is seemly for the occasion and the person concerned; the
sense of proportion in art, which eliminates the redundant
and keeps each detail in its due subordination to the whole.
How prominent this aspect of the critical faculty was with
the Greeks their language itself shows; <em>reason</em> and <em>proportion</em>
are expressed by a common word. ‘The Hellenes,’ Polybius
says, ‘differ mainly in this respect from other men, that
they keep to <em>what is due</em> in each case.’”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Important as it is to gain some little insight into Hellenism
in its secular aspect so that one may realize to some extent
the nature of the influence which it had upon the world, it
is still more important for our present purpose to consider
it from the religious point of view. To this we must now
devote some little attention.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHI_II">II. <span class="smcap">Hellenism in its Religious Aspect</span></h4>

<p>It has already been pointed out that the Hellenistic Movement
coincided with an epoch which was in many respects
one of dissolution; this is distinctly the case in the domain
of religion. The history of religion offers numerous examples
of the fact that there arrive certain periods in which, for one
reason or another, the traditional form of faith ceases to
exercise its power over large sections of the people. One
of two things then follows: either religion gives place to
scepticism, or else the old belief is adapted to the altered
spiritual and intellectual conditions which have supervened.
Among the Greeks of this period we find both processes at
work, though a downright atheistic position is the exception.
Indeed, one of the most interesting and significant facts in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
this connexion is that the philosophy of the Hellenistic
period, in spite of its critical attitude towards religious beliefs,
very soon developed into theology. That is sufficient to
show that, while there was a tendency in certain circles to
pour scorn on religion, the Hellenistic period was very far
from being one of irreligion.</p>

<p>The attitude of the cultured classes towards the national
religion differed, of course, from that of the masses; the
critical spirit and biting sarcasm of the philosophers, a great
deal of which was wholly justified, had the effect of making
it impossible for educated people to accept the old beliefs
in the way in which this had been done hitherto. The
religious ideas taught by the philosophers were, in the main,
altogether subversive of those which tradition had handed
down; nevertheless, to the cultured it would have come as
a relief to be taught, as was done by the Epicuræans for
example, that a man was not godless because he destroyed
belief in the popular gods, but that the godless man was he
who imputed to the gods the popular conceptions concerning
them.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Not that the Epicuræans were irreligious; Epicurus<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
did not attack the belief in the gods as such; on the
contrary, he believed in them himself, and regarded the
universality of this belief as a proof that they actually
existed. But he refused to share the general ideas about
them in their relation to the world, and taught that their
interference in the affairs of men was a thing not to be thought
of since nothing could be worse for men than to feel that at
every turn they might be hampered in their doings by the
gods. That Epicurus strenuously combated the fatalistic
theory of the Stoics can be readily understood. What he
desired above all things to do was to free men from the
fear of the gods; belief in them, he taught, was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
for the fulness of happiness ultimately to be enjoyed in
their presence; but there was nothing in them to be afraid of.</p>

<p>One of the very important things which philosophy did
for religion in this age was that it allegorized, and gave a
new meaning to, the ancient myths,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and thereby made
them of practical religious value at a time when the new
mental outlook would otherwise have necessitated the discarding
altogether of both the substance and form of the
traditional beliefs. As it was, the time-honoured myths
were not rejected in spite of the awakening to new methods
of thought and of ever-increasing enlightenment; this
clearer mental atmosphere had the effect of transforming
the essence of those myths, while retaining their form. To
give detailed examples of the way in which this transformation
was carried out cannot be undertaken here, it would
carry us too far afield; but reference may be made to Wendland’s
work (pp. 115-127) already referred to, and Usener’s
<cite lang="de">Götternamen</cite>, where much interesting information can be
obtained; references to the original authorities are given
in abundance, especially in the last-named book.</p>

<p>But the most striking factor, in the domain of religion, of
the Hellenistic Movement is the <em>religious syncretism</em>, which
was so profoundly characteristic of this period. Within
the wide circle of Hellenized cities and states a variety of
nationalities, eastern as well as western, were represented;
and just as the inhabitants of these had become united and
had learned to live at peace with one another, so did the
various and numerous national deities come to be regarded
not only with tolerance, but also with favour by men to
whom they had hitherto been unknown.</p>

<p>The intermingling of races brought about the intermingling
of beliefs. Wonderfully illustrative of this are the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
associations which formed the characteristic type of religion
during the Hellenistic period; and it is a striking fact that
among the members of these religious associations or guilds
not only Greeks, but foreigners, and these to a preponderating
degree, belonged.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> While, undoubtedly, politics had
a good deal to do with the furtherance of religious syncretism,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
its main motive-power was the piety of individuals.
With the knowledge of the existence of hitherto unknown
gods and goddesses came also the desire to do homage to
them; probably there was also the conviction among many
that, unless these newly found deities were duly honoured,
evil consequences would ensue. The desire to pay fitting
honour to a god is shown by the numerous attributive
names which were frequently addressed to him by his
devotees; and in order to make up for any unconscious
omission the suppliant would add: “Or by whatever other
title thou desirest to be called.” Altars were also frequently
dedicated “to unknown gods,” lest a worshipper should
bring down upon himself the wrath of some deities of whose
existence he was unaware.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The results of this religious syncretism, which was brought
about by the Hellenistic spirit, were far-reaching in their
effect; thus, as an example, it is worth mentioning that
a type of monotheism was taught; this centred in the cult
of Tyche, an all-pervading Fate; and though very inferior
to the monotheism of the Jews, it showed, nevertheless,
that the religious instinct was becoming more expansive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
and was asserting itself in a more rational way than had
hitherto obtained outside of Judaism. Nor must we forget
to add that with the higher conception of the Deity, of
which this was a symptom, there arose among the more
deeply religiously-minded a longing for fellowship with
God, together with the inevitable consequence, a more
developed belief in the future life.</p>

<p>The Hellenistic Movement, therefore, considered at its
best, and apart altogether from the point of view of pure
culture, constituted an immense stride forward in the
enlargening and development of religious thought and belief.
It is difficult to exaggerate its importance for, and effect
upon, religion, and therefore upon all religious literature,
during the period which we specially have in view. Of
this we shall have more to say in estimating the influence
and effect of Hellenism upon the Jews and their religion.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHI_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>The roots of the Hellenistic Movement must be sought
in the conditions brought about by the rise of the Attic
sea-power. The way was thus prepared for the victories
of Alexander the Great, with whose name the spread of
the Hellenistic Movement is more particularly associated,
by his father, Philip; it was through the exertions of the
latter that the Macedonian Empire was consolidated.</p>

<p>The influence of Hellenism was, in the first instance,
exercised by means of the spread of the Greek language;
but it was a form of Greek which differed in many particulars
from classical Greek, and is known nowadays by the name
of Hellenistic Greek. This is the language in which the
Septuagint and the New Testament are written; but it
would be a mistake to speak of it as “Biblical Greek,”
because it was in no sense used specifically for the Greek
of the Bible, but was the ordinary language used in every-day
intercourse, and was developed from the older form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
of Greek. Its wide prevalence is proved by the discovery
of great numbers of <i>papyri</i> and <i>ostraka</i> on which this newer
form of Greek occurs.</p>

<p>The Hellenistic Movement coincided with an epoch which
was, in many respects, one of dissolution, so that its influence
began to spread at a time when men’s minds would be likely
to welcome its newer and broader outlook upon the world.</p>

<p>The greatest centre of Hellenistic culture was Alexandria;
but this was only one, though the most striking, example
of the Hellenization that was going on in many other cities.
The Hellenization of these cities meant that their civic
government was framed upon the Greek model; “barbarians”
and Greeks thus found themselves politically
upon an equality, and the knowledge of one another brought
about in this way resulted in the existence of a cosmopolitanism
which was new to the world.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the directly personal part which each
individual felt that he had to take as a citizen in the administration
of affairs, emphasized his importance, and this
was one of the contributing causes which made individualism
a characteristic of the Hellenistic period. Individualism
was fostered, further, by the philosophical systems of this
period which centred in ethics; for ethical teaching concerns
the individual first and foremost.</p>

<p>The influence of Hellenism was seen in politics, science,
philosophy and literature. The critical faculty of the
Greeks made them realists. In their estimate of men and
things the Greeks were guided by an innate and strongly
marked sense of proportion.</p>

<p>In the domain of religion it is to be noted, first, that
Hellenistic philosophy soon developed into theology; the
Hellenistic period was, therefore, not one of irreligion.
But the critical attitude of the philosophers towards the
traditional religion made it impossible, at any rate for the
cultured classes, to believe in it as heretofore. It was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
however, all to the good that the essence of the ancient
myths was transformed while their form was retained.
Another and most important fact to be noted is the religious
syncretism which was a characteristic of this period; the
intermingling of races brought about the intermingling of
worship. The Hellenistic Movement was the means of a
great development of religious thought; and the resultant
effect on the religious literature of the age is difficult to
exaggerate.</p>

<h4 id="PI_CHII_I">I. <span class="smcap">Hellenism and Judaism</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The influence which Greek thought and culture exercised
upon the Jews and the Jewish religion differed
both in its extent and intensity upon the Jews of Palestine
on the one hand, and upon the Jews of the Dispersion
on the other. It will, therefore, be necessary to deal
separately with these two parts of the subject, although a
great deal of what we shall have to say about Hellenistic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
influence upon the Jews of Palestine will naturally apply
also to the Jews of the Dispersion.</p>

<p>During the two centuries which preceded the appearance
of Alexander upon the world’s stage, the Jews as a
nation had become more and more the people of the Law.
From the time of Ezra onwards this tendency had increased
with ever-growing volume. “Ezra had set his heart to
seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in
Israel statutes and judgements”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; his efforts were crowned
with a great measure of success. By this means it was
sought to preserve the Jewish religion and Jewish ethics
uncontaminated by external influences, whether through
contact with foreign peoples,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or with those who although
they belonged to the Jewish race were not faithful to the
ordinances of the Law.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This separation was successful
at first; but with the rise and rapid spread of Hellenism
it became increasingly difficult to maintain, especially as
the influence of the Greek spirit was, with the exception of
Egypt, nowhere stronger than on the eastern shores of the
Mediterranean. “Girt about by a Greek population, the
Palestinian Jews, in spite of Ezra’s admirable organization,
could not entirely resist the assaults of Hellenism. It is
probable that not merely the Greek language, but also
Greek philosophy, exerted a charm on some of the clearest
Jewish intellects. But we are within the bounds of acknowledged
fact in asserting that the ardour of Judæan piety,
at least in the highest class, greatly cooled in the age
subsequent to Ezra’s, and in ascribing this to Greek
influences.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Of far-reaching importance to the Jews of Palestine,
though only indirectly, was the battle of Ipsus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 301);
for one of the results of this battle was that among the
territories assigned to the house of Ptolemy, according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the settlement agreed upon after the battle, was Palestine
(Cœle-Syria); and there followed, for this country at any
rate, a period of comparative peace which lasted for about
a hundred years.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was, in the main, during this century
that the quiet and peaceful process of Hellenization among
the Jews went on. The wise policy, as it was upon the whole,
of the Ptolemys towards the Jews did much to favour this
process. The Jews were placed upon the same footing as
the Egyptian subjects; they were permitted absolute freedom
in the exercise of their religion and religious customs;
in political matters also the Jews found themselves in a
position of perfect equality with their fellow-subjects;
indeed, so much were they trusted that they not infrequently
formed garrisons in the royal fortresses; of the
existence, too, of Jewish soldiers in the Ptolemaic armies
we have contemporary evidence.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Favourable treatment
was also accorded to the Jews by Seleucus in the northern
parts of Syria; they were, for example, here too granted
the privilege of the rights of citizenship. This kindly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
treatment which the Jews received would naturally have
had the effect of inclining them favourably towards their
rulers; and this was in itself a not unimportant factor in
the new conditions by means of which Greek culture was
exercising its influence upon them.</p>

<p>Again, it was the policy of the Egyptian kings to foster
free intercourse between their Hellenic and Asiatic subjects;
the chief means whereby this was promoted was
by planting Greek settlements in Palestine—following
herein the example of Alexander<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>—which resulted in the
rise of a number of new Greek cities in that country; the
Greeks and Macedonians who consequently became settlers
there constituted before long a numerous and influential
element in the population<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; in many cases they changed
a city which had hitherto been wholly Semitic into one
which became predominantly Greek; examples of this
are Raphia, Gaza, Ascalon, Azotus, Cæsarea, Ptolemais,
and others. Nor was this confined to Western Palestine;
many cities in Eastern Palestine as well became centres of
Greek influence. Invariably in cases of this kind the local
government of the city was framed on the Greek model;
this meant the independent organization of large municipal
communities which, as Schürer points out, was of “fundamental
importance in the political life of Palestine; this
was,” he continues, “indeed, no novelty in Palestine, where
from of old the large towns of the Philistine and Phœnician
coasts had formed centres of political life. The influence
of Hellenism marks, however, a turning-point in this respect
also. For, on the one hand, it essentially transformed the
existing communities, while, on the other, it founded
numerous new ones and made the municipal communities in
general <em>the basis of the political organization of the country</em>
in a far more thorough manner than before. Wherever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Hellenism penetrated—especially on the Philistine coasts
and the eastern boundaries of Palestine beyond the Jordan—the
country districts were grouped around single large
towns as their political centres. Each of such communities
formed a comparatively independent whole, managing
its own internal affairs; its dependence upon the rulers
of Syria consisted only in the recognition of their military
supremacy, the payment of taxes, and certain other performances.
At the head of such a Hellenistically organized
community was a democratic senate of several hundred
members.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It cannot be doubted that the organization
on Greek models of the local government of Jewish cities
must have brought a new mental outlook to the Jews. The
political assemblies and annual elections in which each
individual took his part must have tended to give to the Jew
a sense of his personal importance such as he is not likely
ever to have experienced before. In the past history of
the Jewish State a <i lang="fr">régime</i> had obtained in which the ordinary
individual was regarded as of little or no account; the
vast bulk of the people took no part, not even the most
humble, either directly or indirectly, in the conduct of
affairs; they had no voice even in the smaller world of
local matters; they were mere ciphers without anything
in the shape of civic responsibility. Individual responsibility
had, it is true, been insisted upon in the domain of
religion by Ezekiel<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; but it was a new <i lang="fr">rôle</i> that the Jew
was now called upon to fill in this individual capacity.
As a member of a community organized according to Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
ideas he would feel that he had a real part to play and some
contribution to offer for the general welfare; he would
know that his decision would go towards affecting for good
or ill the conditions under which he and his fellows lived.
Such a new experience could not fail to generate in the Jew
a new sense of personal responsibility, a realization of duty
towards others, not only of his own race, and thus develop
a wider outlook and a deeper insight into the world of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>Another thing which must have appealed strongly to the
imagination of an oriental people like the Jews, though it
would have affected them in a very different way, was the
interest and fascination afforded by the shows and processions
associated with the annual Greek festivals. That
such sights had an alluring effect, and indeed something
more, upon some considerable section of the people is
evident, for the first book of Maccabees shows us that the
question of the adoption of Greek polytheism was first
raised in Judæa by apostate Jews themselves; the passage,
to which we shall have to refer again later, is 1 Maccabees
i. 11 f.: “In those days [i.e., in the days of Antiochus Epiphanes]
came there forth out of Israel transgressors of the
Law, and persuaded many, saying, Let us go and make a
covenant with the Gentiles that are round about us; for
since we parted from them many evils have befallen us. And
the saying was good in their eyes. And certain of the
people were forward herein, and went to the king, and he
gave them licence to do after the ordinances of the Gentiles.
And they built a place of exercise (‘gymnasium’) in Jerusalem
according to the laws of the Gentiles; and they
made themselves uncircumcized, and forsook the holy
covenant, and joined themselves to the Gentiles, and sold
themselves to do evil.” It is rightly pointed out that in
this the promoters “had no doubt an eye to tactics in the
way they chose to inaugurate their campaign. A gymnasium<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
would appeal especially to youth; and if the Jewish
youth could be won over to pagan practices, then the future
was theirs.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The gymnasium was, in truth, one of the
most potent means whereby the Greek spirit was fostered,
especially among those entering upon manhood. Mr.
Edwyn Bevan writes so interestingly on this subject and
so much to the point, that we cannot refrain from quoting
his words. He says: “The gymnasiums were as much of
the essence of a Greek state as the political assemblies;
they expressed fundamental tendencies of the Greek mind—its
craving for harmonious beauty of form, its delight
in the body, its unabashed frankness with regard to everything
natural.... The gymnasiums also served other
by-ends besides the one of bodily training; they were
the social centres in which the life of a Greek youth got
those interests which go with companionship, the spur of
common ambitions, and <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>. From the days
of Alexander and his successors we find as a regular institution
in Greek cities guilds of young men, called <em>epheboi</em>,
attached to the gymnasiums and organized under state
control. A young man might remain in the ranks of the
<em>epheboi</em> for a year. He wore a distinctive uniform, some
variety of that Greek country dress—the dress worn for
hunting, riding, travelling—which consisted of a broad-brimmed
hat, <em>chlamys</em> brooched about the shoulders, and
high-laced boots.... In state processions the body of
<em>epheboi</em>, wearing sometimes even crowns of gold, formed a
brilliant cluster in the spectacle.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In a large variety of
ways, therefore, in every-day life Hellenism affected and
influenced the Jews of Palestine.</p>

<p>This influence was furthered by the powerful high-priestly
party, “the sons of Zadok”—not that all the members of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
this party were necessarily priests—who were the political
leaders of the people and at the same time in favour of Greek
culture. The active and aggressive championship of
Hellenism by this party began with the advent of Antiochus
Epiphanes to the Syrian throne in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 175. The high-priest
at this time was Onias III; but he was not a supporter
of Hellenistic influence among his people; he was, therefore,
driven away by his brother Jesus, a thorough-going Hellenist,
who changed his Jewish name for the Greek Jason.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The second book of Maccabees gives us an account of what
happened, which may be accepted as substantially correct;
in iv. 7-17, it is said: “But when Seleucus died, and Antiochus,
who was called Epiphanes, succeeded to the kingdom,
Jason, the brother of Onias, supplanted his brother in the
high-priesthood, promising in a petition to the king three
hundred and threescore talents of silver, besides eighty
talents from another fund; in addition to which he undertook
to pay a hundred and fifty more, if he was commissioned
to set up a gymnasium and ephebeum, and to register the
Jerusalemites as citizens of Antioch.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And when the king
had given his assent, Jason at once exercised his influence
in order to bring over his fellow-countrymen to Greek
ways of life ... and seeking to overthrow the lawful
modes of life, he introduced new customs forbidden by the
Law; he deliberately established a gymnasium under the
citadel itself, and made the noblest of the young men wear
the petasus.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And to such a height did the passion for
Greek fashions rise, and the influx of foreign customs,
thanks to the surpassing impiety of that godless Jason—no
high-priest he!—that the priests were no longer interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
in the services of the altar, but despising the sanctuary,
and neglecting the sacrifices, they hurried to take part in
the unlawful displays held in the <em>palæstra</em> after the quoit-throwing
had been announced, thus setting at nought what
their fathers honoured, and esteeming the glories of the
Greeks above all else.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> We have quoted this passage in
full as it well illustrates the way in which the high-priestly
party, headed by Jason, furthered the Hellenistic Movement
in Palestine. Mixed motives probably prompted
Jason and his followers in their action; it was certainly to
the party’s advantage, not to say necessity, to be on good
terms with the ruling powers; on the other hand, it is
likely enough that they were convinced of the superiority
of Greek culture, and honestly thought that it was for the
good of their people that it should be cultivated; but their
unnecessarily aggressive methods, coupled with the brutal
action of Antiochus in trying to stamp out Judaism altogether,
brought an inevitable reaction; and there followed,
as a result, the Maccabæan revolt which had the effect of
obliterating Hellenism, as far as this was possible, in Palestine.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It had, however, become too deeply ingrained to
be altogether eradicated; this will be seen as we proceed.
But it may be pointed out here that one of the signs of
how deep and widespread Hellenistic influence must have
been among the Jews of Palestine is to be seen in the large
number of hebraized Greek words which, as the Hebrew of
the Mishna shows, had become incorporated into the language
of the Jews. Schürer has gathered a great many
examples of this, for the examination of which recourse
must be had to his work<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; here it must suffice merely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
indicate the different departments of life in reference to
which these foreign Greek words became current; they
include civil government, the army, jurisprudence, public
institutions such as heathen games, the theatre, the baths,
and public inns, architecture in general, plastic art, music,
writing, trade and industry, the coinage system, provisions,
clothes, furniture and domestic utensils; in addition to
this we find that the formation of many proper names is
Greek, and that multitudes, of Greek words were adapted
which express ideas on many various subjects. Schürer
gives the following summary of the way in which Hellenistic
culture affected the every-day life of the Jews of Palestine:
“It fashioned in a peculiar manner the organization of the
state, legislation, the administration of justice, public
arrangements, art and science, trade and industry, and
the customs of daily life down to fashions and ornaments,
and thus impressed upon every department of life, wherever
its influence reached, the stamp of the Greek mind.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>From what has been said it is evident that Hellenistic
influence upon the Jews of Palestine was very marked, for
although it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to trace step
by step the progress of this influence from its inception,
we are able to see plainly enough how profoundly it must
have affected the Jews. The question, however, arises
as to whether the religious beliefs of the Jews were influenced
by Hellenism. That a large number of Jews prior to the
Maccabæan struggle gave up their traditional belief in their
pursuit after everything that was Greek is clear from the
evidence of the books of the Maccabees; but the point is
rather as to whether Judaism as a faith was in any way
permanently affected by the Hellenistic spirit. Restricting
ourselves at present to Palestinian Judaism we may say
without hesitation that its fundamental tenets remained
untouched; but as regards various beliefs which, in process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of time, became part and parcel of Judaism, it was different;
it cannot be denied that these, of which mention will be
made presently, do witness to the action of extraneous influences,
permanent in their effect, of which Hellenism was
one. “In no period,” says Wellhausen, “was Judaism so
fruitful as in this. It was, like Islam, of complex appearance,
full of antinomies, receptive like all that is living,
unsystematic, only to be understood in its historical setting.
It was only practical religion which was ruled by a pedantic
spirit and by strict discipline; in the domain of belief and
religious conception a curious freedom was permitted,
although certain fundamental doctrines were rigorously
shielded.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The difficulty of estimating to what extent
Jewish religious thought and practice were affected by outside
influences is very considerable; not less difficult is it
to determine <em>what</em> outside influence had affected a given
belief or custom. We are dealing specifically with Hellenistic
influences, but these could be, and were, exercised
both directly and indirectly. It must be remembered that
the conditions under which the Jews lived during the period
with which we are dealing, viz., in the midst of surrounding
nations which had all, more or less, come under Hellenistic
influences, and among whom the development of culture
and religion had been, and was, proceeding apace—it must
be remembered that these conditions were one of the consequences
of the Hellenistic Movement.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Further, the question
must always be borne in mind as to whether some
eastern <em>trait</em> which was absorbed by Judaism had not first
been assimilated by Hellenism with its strongly syncretistic
tendency, and then taken up by Judaism through this Greek
channel. Even in the cases in which eastern elements were
directly taken up into Judaism, must we not see in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Jewish syncretism at any rate the indirect result of Hellenistic
influence? This readiness to accept what other
religions had to offer was of the essence of the Hellenistic
spirit. As illustrating this latter point we may mention
the subjects of Jewish angelology and demonology; it
may be regarded as certain that the later Jewish idea of
angels, the names of which the Jews themselves describe
as originating in Babylonia, the opposition between good
and bad angels, the latter being subject to a personal head,
the dualism between the realms of light and darkness, in
a word, the whole belief in the existence of good and evil
spirits, was due to the influence of Parseeism. In the domain
of eschatology extraneous influences were very marked,
though it is not easy always to decide the quarter from
which these came. As Bertholet says: “Jewish eschatology
has become the very meeting-place of foreign elements.
It is especially the merit of Prof. Bousset, who in general
has dealt most successfully with our problem, to have shown
clearly that the expectation of a transcendent æon which,
inaugurated by a universal judgement of the world, replaces
the æon of this present world, differs so widely from the
expectation of a Messianic future which essentially concerns
Israel alone and, on the whole, will only be enacted on the
stage of this present earth, that they cannot have sprung
from the same root. And here, considering the ideas about
periods of the world, resurrection, general judgement, universal
conflagration, a new world, and everlasting life, we
have first to take into account influences from Parseeism,
mixed with Babylonian elements, only incidentally Greek
ideas....”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Bousset, however, believes that in the
domain of Jewish eschatology Greek influence predominated
over that of the east, though he fully recognizes the influence
of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Regarding the Jewish belief of the immortality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of the soul, there can be no doubt that for this the
Jews were indebted mainly to Hellenism, though the development
of this into the doctrine of the resurrection of the
body is Jewish. That the new material thus absorbed
became integral and permanent elements of Judaism is to
be seen by their presence in Rabbinical literature.</p>

<p>But the influence of Hellenistic or other extra-Judaic
thought on the religion of the Jews cannot be restricted to
those points of doctrine on which, as in the case of the ones
just enumerated, that influence was direct. All religious
doctrines are so inter-related that the development or
modification of one can scarcely fail to affect others in one
way or another; and this is, above all, true regarding the
doctrine of God. We shall see later that among the Jews
of the Dispersion the doctrine of God was directly affected
by Greek philosophical thought; in the case of the orthodox
Judaism of Palestine this was not so; but there is reason
for believing that <em>indirectly</em> the doctrine of God was, even
in Palestinian Judaism, affected by both Greek and oriental
thought. The developed angelology which became a
characteristic of orthodox Judaism had its share in moulding
that conception of divine transcendence which was one
aspect of the Jewish doctrine of God; the teaching concerning
those semi-divine, superhuman beings who act as God’s
intermediaries, and are His agents in carrying out the divine
will on earth,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> is one which is not unconnected with the
developed angelology of later Judaism; one has only to
think of the place and activity assigned to Michael to realize
that this is so.</p>

<p>What has been said is also true of the doctrine of the
resurrection for which Judaism was indebted to Hellenism;
here it will suffice to put the question: How could the
doctrine of God <em>not</em> be affected by belief in immortality?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
The question will be sufficiently answered by comparing
the Old Testament doctrine of Sheol with the doctrine
of the resurrection.</p>

<p>Further signs of Greek influence are to be discerned in
some of the books of the Old Testament and of the Apocrypha;
and the Apocalyptic Movement must be specially
considered. But special chapters will be devoted to these.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is necessary to make a brief reference
to the type of Hellenism which grew up in Syria, for this,
too, is a matter of some importance. Attention has already
been drawn to the syncretism which was a characteristic
of the Hellenistic period; one of the results of this was the
absorption of many oriental elements by Hellenism whereby
it was affected for the worse; and the Hellenism of the
east became a very different thing from the Hellenism of
Greece. It was especially in Syria that in course of time
a degenerate form of Hellenism prevailed; we have reason
to believe, says Bevan, “that it was just in Syria that
Hellenism took a baser form. The ascetic element which
saved its liberty from rankness tended here more than anywhere
else to be forgotten. The games, the shows, the
abandonment of a life which ran riot in a gratification of
the senses, grosser or more refined, these made up too much
of the Hellenism which changed the face of Syria in the
last centuries before Christ. ‘The people of these cities,’
a historian wrote, about a hundred years before Christ,
‘are relieved by the fertility of their soil from a laborious
struggle for existence. Life is a continuous series of social
festivities. Their gymnasiums they use as baths, where
they anoint themselves with costly oils and myrrhs. In
the <em>grammateia</em> (such is the name they give the public
eating-halls) they practically live, filling themselves there
for the better part of the day with rich foods and wine;
much that they cannot eat they take away home. They
feast to the prevailing music of strings. The cities are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
filled from end to end with the noise of harp-playing.’ Very
likely that picture is over-coloured.... The man who
wrote it, Posidonius, a man of huge literary industry, and
a philosopher of the nobler school, was himself a Syrian
Greek; but it cannot be altogether untrue.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Considerably
earlier than this, extraneous influences were already
affecting the Jews, for Hecatæus of Abdera (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 306-283)
bears witness of how many Jews were influenced by foreign
ways. He says: “Under the dominations which were
established in later times [he has been writing about Mosaic
times], namely that of the Persians, and that of the Macedonians
who overthrew the Persian rule, the Jews greatly
modified their traditional ordinances through their contact
with strangers.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Oriental and Hellenistic influences were thus both at
work in influencing the Jews of Palestine in many directions;
the fusion of these two influences took place, and the result
was that a debased form of Hellenism was produced. On
the one hand, then, Hellenism, with the many good qualities
which were inherent in it, brought a beneficial influence
to bear upon the Jews of Palestine; but, on the other hand,
its effect, for the reason given, was evil; so that when the
great reaction against Hellenism took place, it was fostered
by ethical as well as religious considerations.</p>

</div>

<p>The name Essene is in all probability derived from the
Aramaic word which is the equivalent of the Hebrew <em>Chassid</em>
(“Pious”).<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The question as to whether any signs of
Hellenistic influence are to be discerned in Essenism is one
upon which much difference of opinion exists among scholars.
A massive literature upon the subject exists. To go into
much detail here would be out of the question; we can only
refer to a few points which make it difficult to believe that
Essenism was uninfluenced by Hellenism.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>There are, undoubtedly, a number of facts regarding
Essene belief and practice which show how un-Jewish they
were in some respects, though, as Josephus says, they were
Jews by race.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Philo, who is our earliest authority regarding
the Essenes, says: “In the first place, these men live
in villages, avoiding the towns on account of the sinfulness
that reigns in them; for they know that just as disease
arises through unwholesome air, so, too, incurable infection
to the soul through intercourse.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This withdrawing
from the world is elsewhere extolled by Philo when he speaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of it as characteristic of those Greeks and barbarians who
have dedicated their lives to the search for wisdom, and
“who have turned their backs upon the crowded market-place
and public life in order that they may be able to devote
themselves to meditation in their solitude.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It is unnecessary
to insist upon the fact that withdrawing from the world
and seeking solitude was entirely un-Jewish; the Jews were
essentially social in their habits of life, their whole legislation
assumes this, and their history shows it throughout.
It is, therefore, not from the Jews that the Essenes acquired
this characteristic. There are, on the other hand, ample
grounds for believing that among the Greeks and Orientals
examples of this were to be found; it is from one or other
of these, probably from a Greek pattern borrowed from the
east, that the Essenes adopted this.</p>

<p>Again, the Essenes exhibited another very un-Jewish
<em>trait</em> in the position they took up on the question of marriage;
the evidence of Josephus regarding this is as follows:
“They neglect wedlock, but choose out other persons’
children while they are pliable and fit for learning, and
esteem them to be their kindred, and form them according
to their manner of life.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This was quite against Jewish
teaching and practice, though in agreement with Jewish
Hellenism, which looked upon asceticism as the most efficacious,
and indeed indispensable, means of attaining to
the vision of God.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The asceticism of the Essenes, both
in this and other respects, was an inevitable result of their
dualism. According to their teaching, God and the world,
which is wholly evil, stand opposed in irreconcilable
antagonism; this accounts for their elaborate angelology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
for as God cannot have any immediate intercourse with
the evil world, angels act as His intermediaries. This part
of Essene belief is largely due to Persian influence. Further,
Josephus tells us that “the sect of Essenes affirms that
fate governs all things, and that nothing befalls men but
what is according to its determination.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> On this point
the Essenes and the Sadducees were at opposite extremes,
while the Pharisees occupied a middle position between
the two.</p>

<p>Of great importance was the teaching of the Essenes on
the resurrection. “The opinion is strongly held among
them,” says Josephus, “that bodies are corruptible, and
that the matter they are made of is not permanent; but
that the souls are immortal, and continue for ever, and
that they come out of the most subtle air, and are united
to their bodies as to prisons, into which they are drawn by
a certain natural enticement; but that when they are set
free from the bonds of the flesh, they then, as released from
a long bondage, rejoice and mount upward. And their
opinion is like that of the Greeks, that good souls have their
habitation beyond the ocean, in a region that is neither
oppressed with storms of rain or snow, nor with intense
heat, but that this place is such as is refreshed by the gentle
breathing of a west wind that is perpetually blowing from
the ocean; while they allot to bad souls a dark and tempestuous
den, full of never-ceasing punishments.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This
belief, which Josephus himself regards as due to Greek
influence, is directly opposed to the doctrine of the resurrection
of the body which was a tenet of orthodox Judaism.
Un-Jewish, further, was the fact that the Essenes would
never enter the Temple for fear of becoming contaminated
with the crowds there; so that they did not offer sacrifices;
though, on the other hand, they sent offerings to the Temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>One last point wherein Essenism was un-Jewish in character
was that in some respects it was a mystery-religion;
each community had a central house around which the
brethren of the Order dwelt; in this house they met for
their religious observances; one of these was a common
meal; at this meal special holy garments were worn, which
were put off again when the wearers returned to work;
a priest offered up prayer before and after the meal. Whenever
a new candidate sought admission into the Order he
had first to pass a three years’ noviciate; then, on being
admitted, he underwent a form of baptism, and had to take
solemn oaths to obey the rules of the Order and to keep
its secrets; he had also to swear to observe secrecy
regarding the names of the angels in whom the members
of the Order believed. As the Essenes lived entirely for
the life to come, they were much occupied in attempting
to penetrate the secrets of the future; indeed, they were
accredited with the faculty of foretelling the future;
Josephus says that they were seldom mistaken in their
predictions, and gives three interesting examples of the
correctness of the prophecies.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In a number of respects, therefore, the Essenes differed
fundamentally in faith and practice from orthodox Judaism;
but in their strict monotheism, in their high respect for the
Law of Moses, especially in the matter of Sabbath observance,
and in their frequent purifications, they were thoroughly
Jewish.</p>

<p>While it seems, then, impossible not to recognize in the
Essene Movement to some considerable extent the result
of Hellenistic influence, it is evident that other extra-Jewish
influences, namely, oriental, also had a share in moulding
it. Friedländer speaks of Essenism as “a harmonious
blending of the Mosaic and Hellenic spirit”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
this does not take sufficient account of the oriental influences
whereby Essenism was undoubtedly affected; at
the same time it is certain that Hellenism, with its strongly
syncretistic tendencies, absorbed oriental elements prior
to its more pronounced extension in Palestine, in which
case eastern influence would only have been indirect, while
that of Hellenism would have been the more immediate.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHII_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>The separation of the Jews from the outside world which
was brought about through the exertions of Ezra and those
who followed him, and which had the effect of preserving
the people from extraneous influences, was only successful
for a limited period of time. For with the rise and rapid
spread of the Hellenistic Movement came the breaking
down of all the barriers which had been so laboriously set
up; and the Jews, like the rest of the world of those days,
came under the sway of this irresistible power, so strongly
exercised on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Hellenistic influence upon the Jews was exercised in an
intensive manner during the century of comparative peace
for their country, which was one of the results of the battle
of Ipsus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 301). The considerate treatment accorded
to the Jews by their rulers during this period was calculated
to help forward the process of Hellenization. The policy
of the Egyptian kings of settling Greeks and Macedonians
in Palestine resulted in the rise of many Greek cities there.
Both in Western and Eastern Palestine civic life was framed
upon the Greek model; a marked individualism among
the Jews was one of the results of this.</p>

<p>Hellenistic influence was exercised, further, by means
of the annual celebrations of the Greek festivals; the
gymnasium and all that this involved became a still greater
means for the spreading abroad of this influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>The fact that the powerful high-priestly party favoured
the Hellenistic Movement did much to forward it.</p>

<p>Thus, by the time that Antiochus Epiphanes came to
the Syrian throne in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 175 much of what was essentially
Hellenistic had become ineradicably rooted in Jewish modes
of life and thought, so much so that when the great reaction
against Hellenism arose in the shape of the Maccabæan
revolt, it was in many directions powerless to effect a return
to the Ezra ideal.</p>

<p>One effect of the deep and widespread influence of the
Hellenistic Movement is to be seen in the large number of
Greek words which, as the Hebrew of the Mishna shows,
have been incorporated into the Hebrew language.</p>

<p>As to Greek influence upon the <em>religious belief</em> of the
Jews of Palestine, it did not directly affect its fundamental
tenets; but in one way or another, in conjunction with
other eastern influences, it did affect Judaism as a faith in
some respects. Angelology and demonology, which Judaism
absorbed from the east, were elements the incorporation
of which may so far be regarded as due <em>indirectly</em> to
the Hellenistic Movement in that the Greek spirit inculcated,
and set the example of syncretism, an example
followed by the Jews no less than by other peoples under
the sway of Hellenism. In the domain of eschatology
both Greek and Eastern influences affected the Jews; which
of the two was the more powerful is not easily decided.
As regards the belief in the future life of the Jews the signs
of Greek influence are plainly discernible.</p>

<p>This influence cannot be restricted, however, to the points
mentioned because the inter-relation of doctrinal tenets
is such that the development or modification of one dogma
affects others; an example of this is the way in which the
later angelology and demonology of the Jews affected their
doctrine of God.</p>

<p>The chapters on “Traces of Greek Influences in the Old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Testament and the Apocrypha” and “The Apocalyptic
Movement” should be read in conjunction with the subject
of this chapter.</p>

<p>The Essene Movement was the outcome of mainly Hellenistic,
but also of Eastern, influences.</p>

<h4 id="PI_CHIII_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Dispersion</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">A preliminary matter to be dealt with is the Dispersion
of the Jews, its origin and extent; after
which we can turn our attention to the special characteristics
of the Dispersion Jews, and the influence of Hellenism upon
them.</p>

<p>The first beginnings of the Dispersion on a large scale
are to be seen in the deportation to Assyria of 27,290 of
the inhabitants of Samaria by Sargon in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 722. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
2 Kings xvii. 23 it is said: “So Israel was carried away out
of their own land to Assyria unto this day” (cp. 2 Kings
xvii. 6; xviii. 11). The general reference to this occurrence
given in the Old Testament is supplemented by an inscription
of Sargon’s in which it is said: “I besieged and captured
Samerina (Samaria): 27,290 people dwelling in the
midst of it I carried off. Fifty chariots I collected among
them, and allowed them to have the rest of their goods.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
A further deportation on a larger scale took place when
Nebuchadnezzar carried captive to Babylon the bulk of
the nation of Judah in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 597; this was supplemented
by further deportations in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 586 and 582 (see 2 Kings
xxiv. 14-16; xxv. 11, 21; Jer. lii. 15, 28-30). Some five
or six thousand exiles returned to Palestine in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 430;
but about a century later, in the reign of Artaxerxes III
(Ochus),<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> there was another deportation, a number of Jews
being transported to Hyrcania, on the Caspian Sea, and
Babylonia.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The great majority of these exiles and their
descendants were content to remain in their new homes,
and many settlements of Jews arose in Babylonia, the centre
of the Eastern Dispersion; from these centres they emigrated
in all directions, and in course of time the chief centre
of the Dispersion came to be Egypt, and of these Egyptian
settlements Alexandria became the most important. The
earliest mention which we have of Jews settling in Egypt
is in one of the Aramaic <i>papyri</i> found a few years ago in
Elephantiné<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>; these <i>papyri</i> consist of official documents—decrees
of the Persian government and public ordinances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of the Jewish colony settled there—as well as private
papers, such as business letters, account books, records of
debt, lists of names and personal correspondence; some
literary pieces were also found in the collection. In one
of these <i>papyri</i>—a petition addressed by the Jewish soldiery
stationed at Elephantiné to the governor of the Jewish
colony—it is stated that the forefathers of the petitioners
had been settled there and had built a temple to their God
Jahu (Jehovah) “since the days of the kings of Egypt.”
The reference is, in all probability, to the Jewish mercenaries
in the army of Psametik I (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 663-609) of which mention
is made in the <cite>Letter of Aristeas</cite>, 12, 13. It was the successor
of Psametik I, Pharoah Necho II, who in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 609 overran
Syria and, having subdued Judah, exiled Jehoahaz to
Egypt (2 Kings xxiii. 29, 34). Not long after, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 586,
Johanan, the son of Kareah, led a number of Jews, among
whom was the prophet Jeremiah, into Egypt (Jer. xlii.,
xliii.); and, according to Jeremiah xliv. 1, there were
Jewish settlements in Migdol, Tahpanes, Noph (i.e. Memphis),
as well as in the district of Pathros in Upper Egypt
(Isa. xi. 11).</p>

<p>These <em>data</em> show that in comparatively early times there
were Jewish settlements in Egypt. But of great interest
and importance is the evidence of the Elephantiné <i>papyri</i>,
mentioned just now; they witness to the presence of Jews
in Egypt during the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The Jewish colony
settled in Syene was a military one; the <i>papyri</i> tell us
that the organization was much the same as in other parts
of the Persian Empire; there was a governor,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> with whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
were associated the priests, who represented the colony in
all dealings with the suzerain power; he sends regular remittances
to the central government, and receives instructions
in all things concerning the colony from the satrap of the
province. Side by side with the civil organization is the
military <i lang="fr">régime</i>; the force is divided into companies called
after the names of their officers; the soldiers of the garrison
each have a small possession of land; their office is hereditary;
when not engaged in war they seem to have led a
comfortable and pleasant life concerning which the <i>papyri</i>
give a number of details. Though the colony was not a
large one, in all probability not amounting to more than
a hundred souls, the fact of its existence is not without
importance for the study of the Dispersion.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>When the Persian Empire was conquered by Alexander
the Great, many Jews emigrated from Persia to the west,
and settled down in the centres of Greek civilization; nor
did it take very long before there was scarcely any part
of the civilized world of those days in which Jewish settlements
did not exist. “The greatly enlarged channels of
commerce, especially by sea-routes, attracted many from
the interior to the coasts. The newly-founded Grecian
cities, rendered attractive by all the achievements of Greek
art and civilization, became favourite resorts. Henceforth,
trade relations, the desire to see the world, soon also political
considerations and (we may well suppose) a certain conscious
or unconscious craving for culture, became operative in
promoting the dispersion of the Jews over the civilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
world.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> About the middle of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
the <cite>Sybilline Oracles</cite> (iii. 271) bear witness to the wide dispersion
of the Jews in saying that “every land and every
sea is full of thee”; the language is hyperbolic, but testifies,
nevertheless, to the ubiquity of the Jews at this time.
Somewhat later Strabo (<i lang="la">circa</i> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 60-<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 20) gives the
following evidence: “These Jews are already gotten into
all cities, and it is hard to find a place in the habitable
earth that has not admitted this tribe of men, and is not
possessed by it.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The most important centre from every point of view,
not only of the Egyptian, but of the whole Dispersion,
was Alexandria. As we have seen, the nucleus of a Jewish
population had existed in Egypt for centuries before the
time of Alexander. When Alexandria was founded Jewish
settlers were at once attracted to it because equal privileges
with all other citizens were accorded them; reference is
made to this in later times in an edict of Tiberius in which
it is said: “Since I am assured that the Jews of Alexandria,
called <em>Alexandrians</em>, have been joint inhabitants in the
earliest times with the Alexandrians, and have obtained
from their kings equal privileges with them, as is evident
from the public records that are in their possession, and
the edicts themselves; and that after Alexandria had been
subjected to our empire by Augustus, their rights and privileges
have been preserved by those presidents who have at
divers times been sent thither; and that no dispute had
been raised about those rights and privileges.... I will,
therefore, that the nation of the Jews be not deprived of
their rights and privileges ... but that those rights and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
privileges which they formerly enjoyed be preserved to
them....”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In another place Josephus tells us that
the Jews of Alexandria had set apart for them “a particular
place, that they might live without being polluted [by the
Gentiles], and were thereby not so much intermixed with
foreigners as before”; this was done by the successors
of Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> On the other hand, Philo says that the
Jews lived in all parts of the city in his day<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; the earlier
exclusiveness of the Jews would naturally be, to some
extent, broken down in course of time when living in Gentile
surroundings, especially in such a centre as Alexandria,
where Jews of wealth and social position lived who would
desire to avail themselves of the high culture enjoyed by
their Gentile fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>Although Alexandria was by far the most important
centre of the Dispersion, not only in Egypt but in the whole
civilized world of those days, there were many other smaller
settlements of Jews in that country; Philo says that the
one million Jews who dwelt in Egypt were to be found in
every part of it from Libya to the Ethiopian frontier.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Of the many other lands in which Jews were settled we
cannot speak here; it must suffice to say that no country
was without them.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIII_II">II. <span class="smcap">Hellenistic Influence on Religion</span></h4>

<p>It has been pointed out above that among the Greeks
themselves the effect of the new spirit due to the Hellenistic
Movement was very great upon the men and women of the
cultured classes, but that upon the masses it did not exercise
much influence. To a large extent this is also true of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Jews of the Dispersion; for greatly as they were influenced
by the Greek spirit, the point must be emphasized that
this applies, primarily and mainly, to the cultured classes,
<i lang="la">literati</i>, philosophers and the like. No doubt, indirectly,
other classes were to a greater or less extent also affected,
but so far as the fundamental doctrines of Judaism were
concerned, the bulk of the Jews of the Dispersion were, in
the main, true to the traditions of their fathers in spite of
their Greek surroundings, and in spite of the fact that in
other respects they were entirely under the sway of the
Greek spirit. Not only did they pay annually the half-shekel
to the Temple authorities in Jerusalem for the maintenance
of the sacrificial system, but as a rule circumcision
was insisted upon, the sanctity of the Sabbath was observed,
and the great festivals were regularly celebrated. Vast
numbers made pilgrimages to Jerusalem to keep the three
principal feasts, Tabernacles, Passover and Weeks.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Even
Philo, who in mind and character was far more of a Greek
philosopher than a Jewish Rabbi, insists on the need of
observing the distinctive marks of Judaism.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It is necessary
to point this out by way of preface, otherwise from what
we have to say further upon the subject the reader might be
led to suppose that, at all events, the more cultured among
the Jews of the Dispersion, and especially those of Alexandria,
lost touch with Judaism altogether; this, no doubt,
happened in many cases, but as compared with the many
that remained Jews in religion, these were the exceptions.
Nevertheless, in the case of great numbers, traditional
Judaism became transformed. To begin with, utterly
unlike the intolerant attitude of the Palestinian Jews towards
the Gentiles, the Jews of the Dispersion looked upon
the larger world of their surroundings with interest and
sympathy; their religious interests were not so entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
absorbed in their own view of things that they could not see
and appreciate the excellence of Greek thought and philosophy;
their minds were open to receive and to be influenced
by what was good and true, wherever it was to be found.
The Dispersion Jew was a Jew at heart, though not according
to the Pharisaic standard, and convinced of the pre-eminence
of his own faith, but he was none the less ready
to render due justice to the opinions and convictions of
his Greek neighbours; the interesting evidence regarding
this given in the <cite>Letter of Aristeas</cite><a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> (121, 122) is worth
quoting here: “Regarding discussions and explanations
of the Law they possessed great aptitude. They struck
just the right balance, for they discarded the hard literalness
of the letter, and were modest with regard to their own
wisdom, and were ready to hold argument, to listen to the
opinions of others, and to consider thoroughly every question
that might be raised.” This broad-mindedness was one
of the results of unfettered contact with the outer world.
But a result, as remarkable as it was important, followed;
for in comparing his religion with the various beliefs of the
Gentiles, the Jew of the Dispersion became convinced, in
a way which hitherto had not been possible, that both in
faith and practice Judaism was, in so far as its fundamentals
were concerned, immeasurably purer and truer, in most
respects, though not in all, than anything that the Gentiles
could offer. He felt, therefore, that he had something to
say and give to the world which concerned all men. Hence
arose those missionary efforts, so contrary to the spirit of
exclusiveness which characterized traditional Judaism,
but which were crowned with a considerable measure of
success. Yet a grave and subtle danger lurked here for
the Jew of the Dispersion; in his desire to make Judaism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
as attractive as possible to the Gentiles, he presented it
with such modifications that it could no longer be called
genuine Judaism. Under the influence of the Hellenistic
spirit the rigidity of the Law was smoothed down, and some
Jewish beliefs appeared in a somewhat modified form<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>;
many converts did not do more than keep the dietary laws
and observe the Sabbath; and this was acquiesced in. The
reaction of this upon those who thus presented a form of
Judaism which was to some extent spurious, cannot well
have been without its consequences, since their action
must necessarily have affected their own faith in their religion
and their ideas upon the importance of their religious rites.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>If, as we have seen, syncretism affected Palestinian
Judaism we shall expect the same to have been the case
with Hellenistic Judaism; this was, indeed, so, and to a
much greater extent. Thus, their conception of God was
enriched with new ideas from both Platonic and, to a greater
degree, from Stoic philosophy, e.g., the doctrine of Divine
Immanence, to which we shall refer in dealing with the signs
of Greek influence in Jewish religious literature (<a href="#PI_CHAPTER_V">Chapter
V</a>), where we shall see also that the Jewish conceptions of
the nature of man was greatly influenced by Greek philosophical
teaching. Again, the Dispersion Jews commended
their Scriptures to the heathen world by means of interpreting
them allegorically; the real sense of Scripture would
often be entirely explained away by this method. This,
too, shows the influence of the Hellenistic spirit, for this
method of interpretation was borrowed from the Stoics
who had been in the habit of allegorizing the Greek myths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Finally, it is worth pointing out that even in Palestine,
as indications in some later Old Testament and other books
show, there had for generations been a tendency towards
mitigating the importance of the sacrificial system; the
effect of this is likely to have been proportionately great
among the Jews of the Dispersion, who would, moreover,
have found difficulties in observing many other precepts of
the Law. The result would have been to make them all
the more susceptible to the foreign cults and philosophical
systems which met them on every side; how great that
susceptibility was has been illustrated in an extraordinary
manner by the recently found <i>papyri</i> referred to above.
No one, as Bertholet has truly remarked, can understand
the religion of the Jews—and this applies to the Jews of
the Dispersion even more than to those of Palestine—“without
a full intelligence of their astonishing faculty of
assimilation; this assimilation even going the length of
actively supporting heathen cults or, as the recently discovered
<i>papyri</i> of Assouan have informed us, of swearing
by an Egyptian goddess.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Septuagint</span></h4>

<p>One of the results of the Hellenistic Movement, the
importance of which cannot be exaggerated, was the Græco-Jewish
literature to which it gave birth. It is impossible
to deal here with the whole mass of that literature,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> even
in the most cursory manner, nor is this necessary for our
present purpose.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> We must restrict ourselves in this
section to a brief mention of what Schürer calls “the foundation
of all Judæo-Hellenistic culture,” namely, the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, which was the special
possession of the Jews of the Dispersion.</p>

<p>The name of this Greek Version of the Bible owes its
origin to the legend contained in the so-called <cite>Letter of
Aristeas</cite>, in which an account is given of how Ptolemy II
(Philadelphus)<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> desired to have a Greek translation of the
Hebrew Book of the Law (i.e., the Pentateuch), and sent
to Eleazar, the high-priest in Jerusalem, asking him to send
competent scholars to Alexandria who would be able to
undertake the task of translation. The high-priest, the
account continues, readily responded to this request, and
despatched seventy-two learned Jews, each of the twelve
tribes being represented by six of them. Ptolemy received
them with great honour on their arrival in Alexandria, and
entertained them hospitably during the whole of their
sojourn. The seventy-two went into retirement to the
island of Pharos, opposite Alexandria, where they laboured
at the translation. This took seventy-two days; the
translation was then delivered to the king, who thereupon
ordered the books to be placed in the royal library. The
translators, after having been presented with rich gifts,
returned to Judæa. This is the legend to which the name
<em>Septuagint</em> (“Seventy”) owes its origin, a name which has
clung to it in spite of its being now generally recognized
that the <cite>Letter of Aristeas</cite> is unhistorical so far as this story
is concerned. Who the translators of the Hebrew Bible into
Greek were is not known. That the various parts of the
Septuagint were not only translated by different authors,
but also belong to different ages, is certain. It is quite
probable that, so far as the Pentateuch is concerned, the
<cite>Letter of Aristeas</cite> contains a true tradition in ascribing its
translation into Greek to about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 280.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> As to the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg
    60]</span>
of the books, though the evidence is fragmentary, it may
be safely stated that most of them, if not all, were translated
before the beginning of the Christian era. Ryle has shown
that there is evidence for believing that Philo (about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
20-<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 50) utilized all the books of the Greek Old Testament,
with the exception of Esther, Ecclesiastes, Song of
Songs and Daniel.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>This great product of Hellenistic influence upon the Jews
is seen to be all the more significant when it is realized
that in the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Aramaic language, as the
recently found Elephantiné <i>papyri</i> show, was the language
spoken by the Jews of Egypt; and not only was this the
ordinarily spoken language, but it was also that in which
literary works were written.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Yet in the course of not
much more than a century this was displaced by Greek;
and even in the synagogues Greek was the language used.
For some time, no doubt, though apparently not for very
long, the Hebrew Scriptures were translated by word of
mouth into Aramaic in the synagogues of the Dispersion;
but when this language fell into disuse Greek had to be used;
and ultimately it was found necessary to have the Scriptures
themselves in Greek.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>So far as we are here concerned, the great importance
of the Greek Old Testament lies in the fact that it has given
us the books of the Apocrypha. These will be dealt with
separately in Part II, so that it will not be necessary to
say anything about them now further than that the general
purpose for which they were written was to expand some
of the already existing books of the Hebrew Scriptures, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
to add to their number. Some, such as the books of the
Maccabees, continue the record of the nation’s history;
others are expansions of canonical books, such as the Prayer
of Manasses, the Additions to Daniel, Baruch and the Epistle
of Jeremy, and the Rest of Esther; while Ecclesiasticus
and the Book of Wisdom are additions to the Wisdom
Literature of the Jews.</p>

<p>As regards the importance and far-reaching influence of
the Septuagint, we cannot do better than quote the words
in which Deissmann has so succinctly, and yet so adequately,
expressed this: “Take the Septuagint in your hand, and
you have before you the book that was the Bible of the Jews
of the Dispersion and of the proselytes from the heathen;
the Bible of Philo the philosopher, Paul the Apostle, and
the earliest Christian missions; the Bible of the whole
Greek-speaking Christian world; the mother of influential
daughter-versions; the mother of the Greek New Testament.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

Encycl.</cite>, X, pp. 6-18.]</p>
</div>

<p>As the Septuagint is, from our present point of view, the
most important product of the Hellenistic Movement, so
among Græco-Jewish writers is Philo the most remarkable
whom this Movement brought forth. No Jew was so
immersed in the spirit of Greek wisdom, nor did more to
try and harmonize Greek and Hebrew thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The large number of his works which have come down
to us owe their preservation to the popularity they enjoyed
among the early Church Fathers, for by the Jewish leaders
Philo was not regarded as orthodox, his works were therefore
unacceptable to them; some of the Church writers even
went so far as to speak of him as a Christian.</p>

<p>Scarcely anything is known with certainty about his
life. He must have been born about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 20 or thereabouts,
for he took part in an embassy to Caligula in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 40, when
already somewhat advanced in years; he refers to this in
his work, <cite lang="la">De Legatione ad Cajum</cite>, § 28<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; it is also mentioned
by Josephus,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> who speaks of Philo as “a man eminent on
all accounts, brother to Alexander the Alabarch, and one
not unskilful in philosophy.” This is practically all that
is known of him apart from what his works reveal of the
man; but they do not contain any biographical details.</p>

<p>Philo was a true Jew; he had an unbounded veneration
for the Old Testament Scriptures, and especially for Moses
and the Pentateuch; most of his works are concerned with
this latter. Not only did he look upon the Hebrew Scriptures
as having been verbally inspired, but he also believed
this to have been the case with them in their Greek form.
His veneration for the Jewish Scriptures, on the one hand,
and his love for the philosophy of the Greeks on the other,
led him to the conviction that both contained and witnessed
to one and the same truth. He believed that the Greek
philosophers had used the Old Testament writings, and these
he explained on the allegorical system with such freedom
that he was able to extract from them any meaning he
desired; by this means his own philosophical system
became a combination of Greek philosophy and Jewish
theology.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Regarding the philosophy of Philo, his conception of God
forms naturally the starting-point. Here he holds, on the
one hand, that so absolute is the perfection of God, so
transcendent is the divine majesty, and therefore so far
removed from all that human thought is capable of, that
God is simply inconceivable; man can really know no more
than that God is; he cannot know <em>what</em> God is. But, on
the other hand, since He is perfectly good and all-powerful,
since He is the Creator and Upholder of the world, the
Final Cause of all that is or ever can be, it follows that
there must be a ceaseless activity on His part; the world
of His creation must occupy His thought and action. These
twofold conceptions of God—the thought of His being
outside of and above the world, immeasurably superior to
it, and the thought that He is active in the world—are clearly
incompatible one with the other. The way in which Philo
sought to get over the obvious contradiction here involved,
was by assuming the existence of intermediate beings.
His teaching on this subject was not new, but it had never
before been so thoroughly and systematically treated.
These intermediate beings Philo called “powers” (<em>dunameis</em>);
they are properties of God, and yet His servants fulfilling
His will in the world. All these powers are comprehended
in one, namely, the “Logos,” or Word of God; the
“Logos” is also spoken of as the wisdom and reason of God,
and the means whereby the world was created.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> But both
in respect of the “powers” just mentioned, and of the
“Logos” itself, there is uncertainty as to the personality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
attached to them; this was bound to be the case, for if
there was to be even the semblance of a solution of the
opposing conceptions concerning God referred to above,
Philo had to conceive of the “Logos” as less than a personal
being distinct from God, and more than an impersonal
divine attribute; and the same applies to the other “powers.”
Otherwise it would be inconceivable that God could be
personally present and active in the world, while in His
nature He was wholly superior to it, and, on account of
His transcendent holiness, could not come into immediate
and direct contact with it. The “Logos” is, further,
according to Philo, the mediator, and the advocate, of men,
and the expiator of sins; he speaks of it as the “high-priest”;
in such cases it is difficult to get away from the
thought of personality attaching to the “Logos.” On the
other hand, it is conceived of as distinctly impersonal when
described as “the idea of ideas,” and the “archetypal
idea.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Most striking of all is the fact that in a number
of passages Philo gives the “Logos” the title of “first-born
son,” and “only-begotten”; but the significance of
such titles depends, of course, upon the passages in which
they occur.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In his doctrine of sin Philo teaches that evil is inherent
in matter; hence the body, with which the soul is connected,
is the source of sin in man. The subjugation of
the passions is the one and only way to virtue; but this
can only be brought about by means of God’s help, for He
is the Author of whatever is good in man. Therefore
the highest virtue can only be attained by a close communion
with God. Knowledge is excellent; but even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
closest attachment to wisdom is less excellent than walking
with God, for only so can man receive the fulness of divine
illumination. Philo teaches that this divine illumination
is accorded to man while in a state of unconsciousness;
so that while he lays much stress on the freedom of the
will, this highest state to which man can attain is solely
attributable to divine grace.</p>

<p>These doctrines of Philo, and we have only referred to
the more important, are to a great extent due to Greek influence;
Platonism, Pythagoreanism, Stoicism and Cynicism
have all contributed to Philo’s philosophical system; but
to show this in detail would be out of place here, for it would
take us too far afield. We must content ourselves with stating
the fact; for detailed proof recourse must be had to those
works which treat specifically of Philo and of his teaching.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIII_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>In dealing with Hellenistic influence upon the Jews of
the Dispersion it was necessary to make some reference
first to the Dispersion itself and its extent during the period
under consideration. It began as early as the end of the
eighth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> with the fall of the northern kingdom,
and the deportation to Assyria of many thousands of
Israelites which followed. The fall of the southern kingdom
was the cause of a further step in the process of dispersion.
The communities which consequently came into existence
in Babylonia formed centres from which the Jews emigrated
in all directions. We have the evidence of the Old Testament
that such centres existed in Egypt by the middle of
the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, if not earlier. Contemporary documentary
evidence, which has recently come to light, shows
that a colony of Jews was settled at Elephantiné during
the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> After the conquests of Alexander,
many Jews emigrated from the east to western centres of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Greek civilization, and various writers testify to the ubiquity
of the Jews. Alexandria was the most important centre
of the Dispersion from every point of view.</p>

<p>The cultured Jews were more influenced by the Hellenistic
Movement than the masses; both, however, held in
the main to the fundamental tenets of traditional Judaism.
Nevertheless, apart from these, and in spite of their observance,
traditional Judaism became largely transformed.
The tolerant attitude of the Dispersion Jews towards the
Gentiles was in marked contrast to that of the Jews of
Palestine. Unlike these latter, again, a vigorous missionary
propaganda was carried on by the Jews of the Dispersion.
There lay here, however, a subtle danger; for the desire
to make Judaism attractive to the Gentiles resulted in
requiring but scanty observance of its practices from them;
this reacted unfavourably upon the Jews themselves.
Further, a strongly syncretistic attitude characterized the
Jews of the Dispersion; even their conception of God was
influenced by the teaching of the Greek philosophers. The
allegorization of Scripture was another mark of Hellenistic
influence. The recently found Assouan <i>papyri</i> offer a
striking example of the astonishing faculty of assimilation
possessed by the Jews.</p>

<p>One of the most important products of the Hellenistic
Movement was the Septuagint, for which we have to thank
the Jews of the Dispersion. The origin of the name of
this Greek Version of the Hebrew Scriptures is to be found
in a legend contained in the <cite>Letter of Aristeas</cite>. In all
probability the entire books of the Hebrew Canon were
translated into Greek by the beginning of the Christian era.
The most important point about the Septuagint, so far
as we are here concerned, is that it has given us the books
of the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>Among Græco-Jewish writers none can compare in
importance with Philo of Alexandria. His great aim was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
to try to harmonize Hebrew and Greek thought. The
preservation of the large number of his works is due to their
popularity among the early Church Fathers. By the
Jewish leaders he was not regarded as orthodox. Scarcely
anything is known of the life of Philo excepting what can
be gained from his works, and this is little enough.</p>

<p>In the short account given of the philosophy of Philo
it is seen that this is permeated with the spirit of the Greek
philosophers.</p>

<span class="fs135">Traces of Greek Influence in the Old
Testament and in the Apocrypha</span></h3>

<p class="pfs90">[<span class="smcap">Literature.</span>—See the books cited in the footnotes.]</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIV_I">I. <span class="smcap">References to the Greeks in the Old Testament</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">There are some few passages in the Old Testament
which witness to a knowledge of the Greeks on the
part of the Jews; these may be briefly alluded to by way
of introduction.</p>

<p>The Hebrew form for the land of the Ionians, or Greeks,
is <em>Javan</em>; this is mentioned, though without further detail,
in Genesis x. 2; 1 Chronicles i. 5, 7. As early as the eighth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Greeks pressed forward to the east.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Again,
in the lamentation for Tyre (Ezek. xxvii. 13) it is said:
“Javan, Tubal and Meshech, they were thy traffickers;
they traded with the persons of men and vessels of brass
for thy merchandise” (cp. also verse 9). This subject is
referred to again in Joel iii. (Heb. iv.) 6-8, in a woe pronounced
against Tyre and Zidon, and the Philistines: “The
children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
ye sold unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove
them far from their border ...”; these last words, “far
from their border,” suggest that the reference is to the Greek
colonies in the far west. From the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Syrian slaves, among whom Jews must be reckoned,
were much sought after by the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In Isaiah xxiv.
14, 15 it is probable that “the songs of praise which the
Jews in far countries raise in honour of Jahweh were the
result of Alexander the Great’s victorious march through
Asia Minor in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 334.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Mention is made of Javan in
Isaiah lxvi. 19, it is there reckoned among those nations to
whom the glory of Jehovah shall be declared; according
to Zechariah ix. 13-15, on the other hand, Judah and
Ephraim are to be Jehovah’s instruments for the punishing
of the sons of Javan. And, once more, in Daniel viii. 21,
x. 20, xi. 2, there are references to the Græco-Macedonian
empire. In addition to these there are two or three references
to the Greeks in the Septuagint which are not without
significance. In Isaiah ix. 12 (11) it is said that Syria from
the east and the Hellenes from the west are the destroyers
of Israel; in the Hebrew text “Philistines” stands for
“Hellenes,” which is doubtless the right reading; but the
Septuagint rendering is of interest as showing that, when
the translation was made, the real danger for the Jews was
the Greek nation. The same belief evidently underlies
the Septuagint form of Jeremiah xxvi. (= xlvi. in the
Hebrew) 16: “Let us arise and let us return to our people,
to our fatherland, from the face of the Hellenic sword”;
the Hebrew, which has again the correct reading, has “the
oppressing sword” instead of “the Hellenic sword.” The
same substitution for the Hebrew word occurs again in
the Septuagint of Jeremiah xxvii. (= l. in the Hebrew) 16.</p>

<p>These practically exhaust the actual references to the
Greeks in the Old Testament; but traces of Greek influence
are probably to be discerned in other directions.</p>

<p>This influence is obvious in those cases, though they are
but few in number, in which Greek words are adapted;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
this occurs only in the Book of Daniel, where a few Greek
words for musical instruments appear in an aramaized
form, viz., <em>psantērîn</em>, <em>symphōnia</em>, in Daniel iii. 5, and <em>kaithros</em>
in iii. 7 (cp. also iii. 10, 15); the form of the word <em>psantērîn</em>
is interesting, because “this form alongside of the Greek
<em>psaltērion</em> proves the influence of the Macedonian dialect
which substituted <em>n</em> for <em>l</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIV_II">II. <span class="smcap">Traces of Greek Influence in the Old Testament</span></h4>

<p>The question as to the existence or otherwise of Hellenistic
influence in certain other books of the Old Testament
is a difficult one upon which much diversity of opinion
exists among scholars.</p>

<p>We turn first to the Psalms. The majority of scholars
are agreed that a number of the Psalms belong to the Greek
and Maccabæan eras,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and if this is so the possibility of Greek
influence being discerned in them must be recognized. It
is always precarious to base conclusions upon what is
assumed to be the political situation depicted in any particular
psalm; but considerations of another character may
well indicate the <em>age</em> to which a psalm in all probability
belongs; for example, that the conditions which form the
background of many of the Psalms are those brought
about through contact with Hellenism during the period
of the Ptolemaic and Seleucid rule is proved by the fact
that in a number of them a plaintive cry, or vehement
denunciation, is uttered not only on account of the domination
of the heathen, but also because within the Jewish
community itself a religious cleft has occurred; so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
a distinction is made between those of Israel who are faithful
to the Law, and those who are renegades and who are,
therefore, classed with the Gentiles.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> When it is realized
that there is no period in Jewish history, excepting that
just referred to, during which conditions such as these
obtained, it will be granted that there is ample justification
for assigning the Psalms in question to the Greek period.
We agree, therefore, with Friedländer in his belief that
the conflict between the god-fearing, pious Israelites, and
the godless, with which these Psalms are full, really reflects
the attitude of the champions of the old orthodoxy, which
was founded by Ezra, towards the rising tide of Hellenism.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Hellenistic influence, as reflected in certain of the Psalms,
therefore, is only to be seen with certainty in that these
witness to a state of affairs within the community of Israel
brought about by the spread of the Greek spirit.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In the next place we look at the Proverbs. Here it is
the first nine chapters with which we are concerned; there
is a general consensus of opinion among modern scholars that
these chapters form the latest portion of the book. The
marks of Hellenistic influence are briefly as follows: Firstly,
<em>individualism</em>; Wisdom cries, for example, in viii. 4:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Unto you, O men, I call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my voice is to the sons of men.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again in ix. 4-6 she cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whoso is simple let him turn in hither;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, eat ye of my bread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And drink of the wine which I have mingled.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leave off, ye simple ones, and live,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And walk in the way of understanding.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Here, and in other similar passages, it is the individual
who is of importance, not the nation, as in earlier days.</p>

<p>Secondly, <em>universalism</em>; Wisdom says (viii. 15, 16):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">By me kings reign,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And princes decree justice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By me rulers rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is here no restriction to the rulers of the Jewish
nation; Wisdom is for all men, and her sway is worldwide
for those who will have her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I love those that love me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And those that seek me diligently shall find me (viii. 17).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A third mark of Hellenistic influence is the <em>allegorical
form</em> which appears in this book, and especially in the first
nine chapters<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; the most striking example of this is the
“strange woman” spoken of in chapter ii. and elsewhere:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Which forsaketh the friend of her youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And forgetteth the covenant of God;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For her house inclineth unto death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And her paths unto the dead ... (ii. 17-19).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This “strange woman” is undoubtedly an allegorical
person; she is a personification of the new Hellenistic
spirit which, on its bad side, encouraged unbridled licence
and led away from God<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>; we have seen above that there
was a debased form of Hellenism which was especially
present in Syria. This interpretation of what was meant
by the “strange woman” was that of some of the early
Church Fathers.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The writer of these chapters is thus,
probably unconsciously, influenced by the more excellent
<em>traits</em> of the Hellenistic spirit, but is fully alive to its dangers
and warns his readers against them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, a fourth mark of Hellenistic influence is the
<em>hypostatization of Wisdom</em>; the classical passage is viii.
22-36, from which a few verses may be quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Before His works of old.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or ever the earth was....</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When He established the heavens, I was there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When He set a circle upon the face of the deep....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I was by Him, as a master workman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I was daily His delight....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That such thoughts are due to Greek influence scarcely
admits of doubt.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>We come next to the book of Job. In reference to this
O. Holtzmann says with much force that in this book “we
have to do with a religious-philosophical work; and, so
far as we know, the Israelites never evinced any inclination
for philosophy until they came in contact with Hellenism.
Further, we must draw attention to the fact that the book
of Job has as its background the form of a novel, which
flourished everywhere among the Greeks; and this is one
of the clearest signs of the individualistic tendency which
predominated at this period.... Moreover, the form
of dialogue which is peculiar to this book receives thus a
new significance; we have here, without doubt, a Hebrew
imitation of the philosophic dialogue of Plato; and here
one should recall how Plato meditated upon the causes
of human suffering, and how he, too, appreciated the grandeur
and beauty of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The author of the book
of Job takes up a position of antagonism towards the old
orthodoxy, represented by the three friends, as well as
towards the new Hellenistic spirit, the ultimate consequence
of which must, as he sees, lead to atheism, pure and simple.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
His position is thus, in this respect, similar to that of the
author of Proverbs i.-ix. Friedländer sees in the three
friends the “pious ones” of the Psalms.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Further, we
have in the book of Job a conception of Wisdom somewhat
similar to that of Proverbs; in the long passage, xxviii.
12-28, Wisdom is conceived of as God’s co-operator, see
especially verses 20-27; but unlike the teaching of Proverbs
on the subject, there is not the intimate relationship existing
between Wisdom and men; there is only a brief allusion
to this in verse 28.</p>

<p>In the book of Ecclesiastes it is held by many scholars
that traces of Greek philosophy are to be discerned. Tyler,
for example, shows that the passage, iii. 1-8, which gives
a catalogue of times and seasons, is an echo of the teaching
of the Stoics that men should live according to nature.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Again, the thought contained in iii. 18, 19 (“... that
which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even
one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no
pre-eminence above the beasts; for all is vanity ...”)
is certainly in accordance with the Epicurean teaching
regarding the mortality of the soul.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Barton argues strongly
against these views<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; but cogent as many of his arguments
are, they are not convincing in every case; this applies
especially to what he says in reference to the passage, iii.
18, 19: “Koheleth’s denial of immortality differs from
the Epicurean denial. His is but a passing doubt; it is
not dogmatically expressed, and at the end (xii. 7) his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
doubt has vanished, and he reasserts the older Jewish view
(Gen. ii. 7). This older view was not an assertion of immortality,
but the primitive conception that the breath comes
from God and goes back to Him. The Epicureans, on
the other hand, dogmatically argued for the non-immortality
of the soul, and possessed well-assured theories about it.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
This argument is not very convincing; at any rate, it does not
disprove our present point, which is that the <em>traces of Greek
influence</em> are to be discerned in this book. Cornill’s sober
<i lang="la">dictum</i> on the subject generally is, we feel convinced, the
right one, when he says: “The question whether <cite>Koheleth</cite>
shows immediate knowledge of and dependence upon Greek
philosophy is an open one; but so much appears certain,
that such a work could only have been produced by a
Jewish mind imbued, or at least influenced, by Hellenism.”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
St. Jerome, in commenting on the passage, ix. 7-9 (“Go
thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with
a merry heart ...”), remarks that the writer appears to be
reproducing some Epicurean ideas<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>; Cheyne is not surprised
at this, for the book is, as he says, “conspicuous
by its want of a native Jewish background ... it obviously
stands at the close of the great Jewish humanistic movement,
and gives an entirely new colour to the traditional
humanism by its sceptical tone and its commendations
of sensuous pleasure”; and a little further on he says that
“it is perfectly possible to hold that there are distinctively
Epicurean doctrines in <cite>Koheleth</cite>. The later history of
Jewish thought may well seem to render this opinion probable.
How dangerously fascinating Epicureanism must
have been when the word ‘Epicuros’ became a synonym<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
in Rabbinic Hebrew for infidel or even atheist.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Cheyne
does not, however, believe in any traces of Greek influence,
whether Epicurean or Stoic, in the book. “I do not see,”
he says, “that we <em>must</em> admit even a vague Greek influence.
The inquiring spirit was present in the class of ‘wise men’
even before the Exile, and the circumstances of the later
Jews were, from the Exile onwards, well fitted to exercise
and develop it. Hellenic teaching was in no way necessary
to an ardent but unsystematic thinker like Koheleth.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
It is largely a question of the probabilities of the case; for,
in discussing the whole question of the presence or otherwise
of traces of Hellenistic influence in some of the later books
of the Old Testament,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> we must keep before our minds the
fact of the spread of the Hellenistic spirit from the death
of Alexander the Great onwards, and the way in which (as
we have seen in a previous chapter) it affected the Jews in
manifold directions. The important evidence of 1 Maccabees
i. 11 is worth recalling here: “In those days came
there forth out of Israel transgressors of the Law, and persuaded
many, saying, Let us go and make a covenant with
the Gentiles that are round about us; for since we parted
from them many evils have befallen us.” Two points come
out clearly here: there was evidently a strong Hellenistic
party among the Jews in Palestine since these transgressors
of the Law “came forth out of Israel”; the passage also
shows that some time previously relations had existed
between these Hellenistic Jews and the Gentiles, as the
writer says, “since we parted from them.” The Maccabæan
rising was, therefore, the culminating point of a movement
that had been going on long before, viz., a conflict
between orthodox and Hellenistic Jews, the latter being
supported by the ruling powers; or if conflict is too strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
a word to use, then let us say, at any rate, opposing tendencies.
It is, moreover, highly probable that the action
of Antiochus Epiphanes in seeking to stamp out Judaism
was largely prompted by his knowledge of the existence of
considerable numbers of Jews who were in sympathy with
his plan; this seems clear from 1 Maccabees i. 13, where
we read further: “And certain of the people were forward
herein and went to the king (i.e., Antiochus Epiphanes),
and he gave them licence to do after the ordinances of the
Gentiles.” If the Jews of Palestine were thus surrounded
by Gentiles, and were, as we have already seen to be the
case, strongly influenced by the Hellenistic spirit, whether
orthodox or not, it would be according to expectation to
find marks of this influence in those books of the Old Testament
which belong to the Hellenistic period. In the particular
case of Ecclesiastes it is granted that analogies between
Greek philosophy and its ideas exist<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>; it appears to us,
therefore, more probable that these ideas, in view of what
has just been said, were due to the influence of Greek thought
rather than that they were independently reached.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIV_III">III. <span class="smcap">Traces of Greek Influence in the Apocrypha</span></h4>

<p>There are only two books of the Apocrypha which come
into consideration here, but they are the two most important.</p>

<h5 id="PI_CHIV_ECC"><span class="hidden">Ecclesiasticus</span></h5>

<p>First we have the Wisdom of Ben-Sira or Ecclesiasticus.</p>

<p>Ben-Sira was an orthodox Jew; but in spite of this he
betrays in his book the influence that Greek culture had
upon him, and is thus an interesting example of the way
in which the Hellenistic spirit worked upon men unconsciously.
He wrote his book with the purpose, among
others, of demonstrating the superiority of Jewish over
Greek wisdom, so that from this point of view Ecclesiasticus
may be regarded as an apologetic work.</p>

<p>The traces of Hellenistic influence in this book are to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
be found in general conception rather than in definite form;
for example, the identification of virtue with knowledge
is a distinctly Hellenistic <em>trait</em>, and is treated in this book
as axiomatic. No longer are divine and human wisdom
looked upon as though opposed the one to the other, as
had been the case in days gone by; Ben-Sira teaches, and
this is characteristic of the Wisdom literature generally,
that wisdom is the one thing of all others which is indispensable
to him who would lead a godly life. That there
is no opposition between divine and human wisdom was
a doctrine for which Ben-Sira was indebted, whether directly
or indirectly is not the point, to the influence of Hellenism.
In this book the evil of wickedness is represented as
lying in the fact that wickedness is folly, and therefore
essentially opposed to Wisdom; on the other hand, the
Jews as a body were faithful to the Torah, or Law, whose
ordinances were binding because it was the revealed will
of God; therefore, in order to reconcile this traditional
teaching with the newer teaching that Wisdom is man’s
main requirement, Wisdom became identified with the Torah:
“the fear of the Lord [i.e., the observance of the Torah]
is the beginning [i.e., the highest form] of Wisdom.” This
is the foundation-stone of the Jewish Wisdom literature;
and it formed the reconciling link between Judaism and
Hellenism in this domain.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> This identification is nowhere
more evident than in Ecclesiasticus; throughout Ben-Sira
inculcates the need of observing the commandments
of the Law which is man’s highest wisdom, but the Law is
the expression of the divine wisdom; so that he truly says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou desire wisdom keep the commandments,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Lord will give her freely unto thee (i. 26).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Further, the existence of the influence of Greek philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
among some of the cultured Jews of Palestine is reflected
in the book in that Ben-Sira controverts the fatalistic
philosophy of the Stoics; see, for example, such a passage
as the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not, “From God is my transgression”;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For that which He hateth made He not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not, “It is He that made me to stumble,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For there is no need of evil men (xv. 11, 12).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Stoic enumeration of the human senses seems to have
been in the mind of one who added these words after xvii. 4:
“They [i.e., men] received the use of five powers [i.e., the
five senses] of the Lord; but as sixth He also accorded
them the gift of understanding (<em>nous</em>), and as a seventh the
Word (<em>logos</em>), the interpreter of His powers.”</p>

<p>In one passage Ben-Sira utters words which sound rather
like an echo of Epicurean philosophy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give not thy soul to sorrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And let not thyself become unsteadied with care.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heart-joy is life for a man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And human gladness prolongeth days.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entice thyself, and soothe thine heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And banish vexation from thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For sorrow hath slain many,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And there is no profit in vexation.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Envy and anger shorten days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And anxiety maketh old untimely.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sleep of a cheerful heart is like dainties,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And his food is agreeable unto him</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">(xxx. 21-25, according to the Hebrew).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In summing up the traces of Greek influence upon Ben-Sira,
Prof. Israel Levi says: “The fatalistic philosophers
whose opinions he contests were doubtless the Stoics; and
the philosophical discussions instituted by him were innovations
and probably borrowed. His criticisms of sceptics
and would-be freethinkers are further evidences of his
knowledge of Hellenism; and some of his views find close
analogues in Euripides. Not only does he share characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
ideas with the Greek tragedians and moralists, but
he even has the same taste for certain common topics, such
as false friendship, the uncertainty of happiness, and especially
the faults of women. The impression of Greek influence
is strengthened by the presence of a polish quite foreign
to Hebrew literature.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This may or may not be somewhat
over-stated, but there can scarcely be any doubt that,
although the Judaic elements in the book preponderate to
an overwhelming degree, yet Hellenic traits are to be discerned
to a certain extent. Prof. Levi sees the results of
Greek influence in some other directions in the book; thus
he says that “the customs which he (i.e., Ben-Sira) describes
are taken from Greek rather than from Hebrew society;
thus he mentions banquets accompanied by brilliant conversation,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
at which musical instruments were heard, and
over which presided ‘the master of the feast.’” At the
same time it is only right to point out that some scholars
deny that there are any signs of Greek influence in the book.</p>

<p id="PI_CHIV_WIS">We turn now to the book of Wisdom which, as a product of
the Judaism of the Dispersion, is full of the Hellenistic spirit.
The best way to deal with this interesting but somewhat
intricate subject will be to illustrate by quotations the
different Greek philosophical ideas contained in the book,
and then to indicate the teaching of the Greek philosophers
in each case; in this way the influence of Greek philosophy
in the book will be clearly seen.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHIV_a">(<i>a</i>) <i>The doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul.</i></h5>

<p>That this is taken for granted is clear from the words
in viii. 19, 20:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now I was a child good by nature, and a good soul fell to my lot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nay, rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again, in xv. 8, though here pre-existence is not
necessarily implied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... When the soul which was lent him shall again be demanded.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And, once more, in reference to the foolish man who manufactures
idols, it is said (xv. 11):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because he was ignorant of Him that moulded him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And of Him that inspired into him an active soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And breathed into him a vital spirit.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A great deal depends here upon the question of authorship,
or at any rate upon the point of view of the writer;
for it will be noticed that the first of these quotations comes
from part i. of the book, while the last two are from part ii.
We will speak of the point of view of the writer without
assuming that either one or two writers is in question.
There are two points of view represented in these verses;
the ordinary Jewish belief is expressed by the words:
“Now I was a child good by nature, and a good soul fell to
my lot,” as well as by the two other quotations. On
the other hand, a point of view influenced by Greek thought
appears in the words: “Nay, rather, being good, I came
into a body undefiled.” It is well to point out first that
according to the ordinary Jewish belief there was no clear
conception of any difference between soul and spirit; the
Hebrew word for “soul” is <em>nĕphĕsh</em>; but this word does
not correspond properly to “soul”; it means a man’s
own self, his personality, including his body; what we
understand by body and soul is expressed in Hebrew by
this word <em>nĕphĕsh</em>, so that when this is translated by “soul”
it is apt to cause misunderstanding; the Hebrews had no
word corresponding to the Greek <em>sōma</em> (body), nor did
the Greek <em>psychē</em> (soul) correspond with the Hebrew
<em>nĕphĕsh</em>; the Hebrew word which comes nearest to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
<em>psychē</em> would be <em>nĕshāmāh</em> (breath), or possibly <em>rūach</em>
(spirit).<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The words, therefore, “Now I was a child good
by nature, and a good soul fell to my lot,” mean simply that
he was by nature a good child and became also a good man,
by God’s mercy is implied. This traditional faith the
writer supplements, on account of the insight into Greek
philosophy which he had gained, by adding: “Or, rather,
being good, I came into a body undefiled”; he means
thereby that his soul (in the Greek, not the Hebrew, sense,
for he does not include the body) entered into a body undefiled;
he thus expresses his belief in the pre-existence of
the soul. But an interesting point to be noted here is
that the writer, while accepting one Greek doctrine (the
pre-existence of the soul) repudiates another in the same
breath, for by speaking of a “body undefiled” he seems to
be denying the Platonic doctrine of the body being a hindrance
(see below). As to Plato’s teaching on the pre-existence
of the soul, this has been so well summed up by
Zeller that we cannot do better than give it in his words:
“The soul of man is in its nature homogeneous with the soul
of the universe, from which it springs. Being of a simple
and incorporeal nature it is by its power of self-movement
the origin of motion in the body; inseparably connected
with the idea of life, it has neither end nor beginning. As
the souls have descended from a higher world into the
earthly body, they return after death, if their lives have
been pure and devoted to higher objects, to this higher
world, while those who need correction in part undergo
punishments in another world, and in part migrate through
the bodies of men and animals. In its earlier existence
our soul has seen the ideas of which it is reminded by the
sight of their sensuous copies.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>The other two passages, xv. 8 and xv. 11, reflect the ancient
Hebrew belief as contained in Genesis ii. 7: “And the
Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath (<em>nĕshāmāh</em>) of life;
and man became a living soul (<em>nĕphĕsh</em>)”; that is to say, the
<em>nĕshāmāh</em> (which is equivalent to what we understand by
“soul”; there is no real distinction between “soul” and
“spirit” in Hebrew belief<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>) is in existence with God before
man is created. This belief in pre-existence, though quite
different from the Greek doctrine, became elaborated in
course of time, and it was taught that in the seventh heaven
God kept the souls of those whom He intends to send on
earth<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>; the Midrash in which this occurs (<i>Sifre</i> 143<i>b</i>) belongs
in its original form to the earlier part of the second century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and since it undoubtedly preserves much ancient
material it reflects thought long prior to the time when
Wisdom was written. In the passages quoted we have,
then, references to the belief in the pre-existence of souls
as taught by the Jews on one hand and by the Greeks on
the other.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHIV_b">(<i>b</i>) <i>The doctrine of immortality.</i></h5>

<p>We have seen that with regard to the doctrine of the pre-existence
of the soul the author of Wisdom expresses both
Jewish and Greek belief. The same is the case with the
doctrine of immortality; Jewish belief on this subject<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
has already been dealt with in Part I, chap. ix. (<i>f</i>); the
influence of Greek thought is to be discerned in such
passages as the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Court not death in the error of your life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither draw upon yourselves destruction by the works of your hands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because God made not death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither delighteth He when the wicked perish (i. 12, 13).</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">... For righteousness is immortal (i. 15).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reference here is to spiritual death, the soul’s loss of
true life hereafter. Again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And no torment shall touch them (iii. 1).</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They that trust on Him shall understand truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the faithful shall abide with Him in love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because grace and mercy are to His chosen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He will graciously visit His holy ones (iii. 9, cp. xv. 3).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, once more:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Incorruption bringeth near to God (vi. 19).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of such passages Menzel says: “Who does not, in reading
them, recall the Platonic passage <i>Jambl. ad Phaed.</i> pp. 63<i>c</i>,
69<i>c</i>?”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> To quote Zeller again in his summing up of Plato’s
philosophy: “As the soul in its true nature belongs to the
world above the senses, and in that only can find a true
and lasting existence, the possession of the good or happiness
which forms the final goal of human effort can only
be obtained by elevation into that higher world....
The true mission of man, therefore, lies in that escape from
this world, which the ‘Theætetus,’ 176A, identifies with
assimilation to the divine nature....”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>


<h5 id="PI_CHIV_c">(<i>c</i>) <i>The doctrine of the badness of the body.</i></h5>

<p>In ix. 15, 16, it is said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">For a corruptible body weigheth down the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the earthly frame lieth heavy on the mind that is full of cares.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hardly do we divine the things that are on earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the things that are close at hand we find with labour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the things that are in the heavens who ever yet traced out?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Practically all commentators are agreed that verse 15
is based on a passage in Plato’s <cite>Phaedo</cite> (81C), where the
hindrance of the body is spoken of; the verbal similarities
are too striking for this to be denied. The teaching is,
moreover, in agreement with that found elsewhere in the
writings of Plato: “The body ... is the grave and
prison of the soul, which has received its irrational elements
through combination with it, and is the source of all desires
and all disturbances of intellectual activity”; thus Zeller
sums up Plato’s teaching on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>


<h5 id="PI_CHIV_d">(<i>d</i>) <i>The creation of the world out of formless matter.</i></h5>

<p>The term “formless matter” is a Platonic one; but
this doctrine was taught by the Stoics as well as by Plato,
so that we cannot say to which system the author of Wisdom
was immediately indebted in writing these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For Thine all-powerful hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That created the world out of formless matter ... (xi. 17).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In speaking of what Plato meant by the term “matter”
Zeller says: “By Plato’s matter we have to understand
not a mass filling space, but space itself. He never mentions
it as that out of which, but only as that in which,
things arise. According to him, bodies are formed when
certain portions of space are thrown into the shapes of the
four elements. That it is not a corporeal mass out of which,
they arise in this manner is clear from the assertion that
when they change into one another they are broken up
into their smallest <em>plane</em> dimensions in order to be compounded
anew out of these. To carry this theory out
strictly was difficult; and in another place (<i>Tim.</i> 30A, 52 D, f.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
69B) he represents the matter as if the Deity, when engaged
in the formation of the elements, had found ‘all that
is visible’ already in existence as a chaotic mass moving
without rule.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>


<h5 id="PI_CHIV_e">(<i>e</i>) <i>Signs of the influence of Stoic philosophy.</i><a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></h5>

<p>Most commentators, from Grimm onwards, hold that the
idea of the <i lang="la">Anima Mundi</i>, or World Soul, of Stoic philosophy
is to be discovered in such passages as the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... Because the spirit of the Lord filleth the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And that which holdeth all things together hath knowledge of every voice (i. 7).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The all-pervading character of Wisdom, described in vii.
22-24, contains a similar thought:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For there is in her a spirit quick of understanding, holy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Alone in kind, manifold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Subtil, freely moving,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Clear in utterance, unpolluted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Distinct, that cannot be harmed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Loving what is good, keen, unhindered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Beneficent, loving toward man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Steadfast, sure, free from care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All-powerful, all-surveying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And penetrating through all spirits</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That are quick of understanding, pure, subtil.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Wisdom is more mobile than any motion;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, she pervadeth and penetrateth all things by reason of her pureness</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">(cp. also vii. 27, viii. 1).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another Stoic doctrine is that of the metabolism of the
elements, “by the help of which the writer of part ii.
endeavours to rationalize the miracles of the Exodus....
The metabolism of the elements at the end of part ii.,”
says Holmes,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> “is traced by E. Pfleiderer to Heraclitus,
and to him directly, rather than indirectly through the
Stoics, on account of the allusion in chapter xix. to three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
elements only—fire, water, earth—since Heraclitus recognized
only three. But it is difficult to see how the author
could have brought in the idea of air changing into anything
else: water changes into earth in the passage through the
Red Sea, and earth becomes water again to overwhelm
the Egyptians; fire lost its power and was unable to melt
the heavenly food; what need or opportunity was there
for adducing the change of air into another element?...
It must, no doubt, be admitted that the Book of Wisdom
has points of connexion with the system of Heraclitus, who
was highly esteemed in Alexandria, but whether directly
or indirectly it is impossible to say.” The passage in
question is xix. 18-21:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the elements changed their order one with another....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For creatures of dry land were turned into creatures of waters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And creatures that swim trode now upon the earth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fire kept the mastery of its own power in the midst of water,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And water forgat its quenching nature.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contrariwise, flames wasted not the flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither melted they the ice-like grains of ambrosial food, that were by nature apt to melt.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Lastly, reference may be made to viii. 7, where we find a
classification of the four cardinal virtues, which the Stoics
copied from Plato:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And if a man loveth righteousness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The fruits of Wisdom’s labour are virtues,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For she teacheth <em>self-control</em> and <em>understanding</em>, <em>righteousness</em>, and <em>courage</em>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there is nothing in life more profitable than these.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Most of the marks of Greek influence in this book have
now been mentioned; it is probable enough that we have
missed some, but we venture to think that the most important
have been dealt with.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIV_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>There are not many direct references to the Greeks in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the Old Testament; in a few scattered passages <em>Javan</em>,
the Hebrew form for the land of the Ionians (i.e. Greeks),
is found. Three interesting instances of variation from the
Hebrew occur in the Septuagint; the word “Greek” being
substituted for “Philistine” in one case, and “Hellenic
sword” for “oppressing sword” in two others. These
deliberate alterations were made because it was believed
by the Greek translator that the real danger for the Jews
lay in the spread of the Greek spirit. In the Book of
Daniel a few Greek names of musical instruments have been
adopted.</p>

<p>Traces of Greek influence are to be discerned in all probability
in some of the Psalms, for they witness to a state
of affairs brought about by the working of the Greek spirit.
In the first nine chapters of Proverbs, too, there are marks
of Hellenic influence, e.g. individualism, universalism,
the use of allegory and the hypostatization of Wisdom.
In the Book of Job the same influence may be discerned
in the philosophic cast of the speeches, in its imitation
in form of Plato’s dialogues, and in the fact that the background
of the book is cast in the form of a novel, which was
likewise imitated from the Greeks. As to Ecclesiastes,
opinions differ as to whether it exhibits direct borrowing
from Stoic and Epicurean thought; but it certainly contains
analogies with Greek philosophy.</p>

<p>In the Apocrypha only two books come into consideration,
but they are the two most important. Ecclesiasticus was
written with the purpose, among others, of demonstrating
the superiority of Jewish over Greek wisdom; at the
same time, Ben-Sira often shows himself influenced, unconsciously
it may be, by the latter, although the Judaic elements
in the book preponderate to an overwhelming degree.
The Book of Wisdom, a product of the Judaism of the Dispersion,
is full of the Hellenic spirit; this comes out very
clearly in the treatment of the doctrines of the pre-existence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of the soul, of immortality, of the body as evil, and of the
creation of the world out of formless matter. Further,
most commentators find the influence of Stoic philosophy
in the ideas of the <i lang="la">Anima Mundi</i> and of the metabolism of
the elements, as well as the classification of the four cardinal
virtues which the Stoics copied from Plato.</p>

<h4 id="PI_CHV_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Beginnings of the Apocalyptic Movement</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The fundamental ideas which ultimately developed
into Jewish Apocalyptic go back to a hoary antiquity.
Many of these ideas are present in one form or
another in the Old Testament; but the different sources,
some undoubtedly indigenous, others extraneous, whence
these ideas emanated have, in all probability, a much
longer history behind them. With the history and development
of early Apocalyptic thought we are not here concerned,
since our object is only to deal with <em>Jewish</em> Apocalyptic,
and this merely in its broad outlines as it appears in what is
called the Apocalyptic Movement.</p>

<p>When specifically Jewish Apocalyptic commenced it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
not possible to say, for the doctrines and hopes and fears
which it taught must have been in men’s minds and have
been widely inculcated long before it appeared in the form
in which we know it, namely, its literary form. But it is
not difficult to indicate the approximate date at which the
Apocalyptic literature, known to us, began to come into
existence; this was somewhere about the period 200-150
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; from that time it continued to grow during a
period of about three centuries. The early beginnings of
this literature, therefore, date from a time prior to the
Maccabæan struggle. Before the Maccabæan era the two
great opposing parties, Sadducæan and Pharisaic, did not
exist. It is more than probable, however, as we have
seen, that the <em>tendencies</em> which, later, developed and
became directly antagonistic were already in being, and
that the Maccabæan struggle had the effect of greatly
strengthening them. Further, in pre-Maccabæan times,
owing to the influence of the Hellenistic Movement, an
universalistic spirit prevailed very largely among the Jews;
they saw no objection to associating with the Greeks,
were glad to learn from them, and welcomed the free and
wide atmosphere which was characteristic of Greek thought.
The result was that Jewish Apocalyptic, enriched by extraneous
ideas and beliefs, flourished among the people;
to many it brought light and comfort because it solved
problems which had hitherto appeared insoluble; that
this life was merely preparatory to a happier and fuller
one after death, when the godly would come to their own
and the wicked would receive their recompense, such a
doctrine laid at rest the doubts and heart-searchings of those
who were shocked at seeing the prosperity of the wicked,
and who were grieved at the adversity and sorrow of the
righteous. Jewish Apocalyptic, therefore, flourished; it
appealed to the mass of the people, for it inspired them
with hope; it was individualistic, so that each felt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
here was a message for him in particular as well as for the
nation at large.</p>

<p>We have said that in the pre-Maccabæan era the tendencies
which in later years had the effect of calling into
existence two antagonistic parties were already present;
we have also said that the Jews <em>as a whole</em> were more or
less imbued with the Hellenistic spirit; let us explain
our meaning a little more fully. Not all the Jews at this
period were Hellenistically inclined, though the bulk were,
and the <em>influence</em> was more or less upon all; but there was
a minority of the nation which had followed in the wake
of those who since the time of Ezra and Nehemiah had
clung tenaciously to a rigid observance of the Law; not
that they were wholly uninfluenced by the Hellenistic
spirit, any more than the more thorough-going Hellenistic
Jews as a body were really disloyal to the Law. This
minority consisted of those who were called the “Pious
ones,” or <em>Chassidim</em><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>; it was connected with the Scribes,
for in the important passage, 1 Maccabees vii. 12-14, it is
said: “And there were gathered together unto Alcimus and
Bacchides a company of scribes, to seek for justice. And
the Chassidim were the first among the children of Israel that
sought peace of them....” It was the <em>Chassidim</em> who
in post-Maccabæan times developed into the distinct party
of the Pharisees, the party of rigid orthodoxy, legalistic,
exclusive, and narrow. Opposed, then, to the ideas of this
minority were those who were led by the governing classes
and the family of the High-Priest; men who were the
friends of Hellenistic culture, and who were not legalistic
in the sense that the <em>Chassidim</em> were. These represented
what in post-Maccabæan times became the Sadducæan
party. It cannot, however, be too strongly insisted upon
that, as already pointed out, in pre-Maccabæan times
there was neither a Sadducæan nor a Pharisaic <em>party</em>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
great mass of the people, including many among the <em>Chassidim</em>,
in these pre-Maccabæan times, was not ranged definitely
on either one side or the other of those who represented
the two tendencies just referred to; their main religious
interest was Apocalyptic. We feel convinced that the
evidence concerning the various religious thought-tendencies
in pre-Maccabæan times, taken as a whole, supports M.
Friedländer’s contention that “the great mass of the
people, the multitudes (<em>Am-haarez</em>) remained before and
after [i.e. of the Maccabæan struggle] under the spell of the
Hellenistic spirit; and, as in the case of the ruling parties,
they, too, had, also in post-Maccabæan times, their teachers
and their ‘Pious’ ones. These teachers were the <em>Chassidim</em>
and the creators of the apocalyptic literature.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> These
Apocalyptists, therefore, had this in common with the
Pharisees that both were descended from the ‘Pious ones,’
or <em>Chassidim</em>; only, as Friedländer puts it, “whereas the
Pharisees were the bodily descendants of the pre-Maccabæan
‘Pious ones,’ the Apocalyptists were their spiritual
descendants; the former transformed the faithfulness to the
Law of their forefathers into legal burdens, the latter clung
loyally to the simple belief of those self-same forefathers,
a belief which was not blurred by intricate learning and a
superabundant ‘oral tradition’; theirs was a piety, on
the contrary, which was born of the spirit of the times and,
therefore, such as was characteristic of the common folk.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>It will, no doubt, strike some as incongruous that the
Pharisees, with their circumscribed anti-Hellenistic views,
and the Apocalyptists, with their enlarged purview and pre-Hellenistic
ideas, should be said to have possessed a common
ancestry; but there are two facts which are of themselves
sufficient to show the probability of this having been the
case: belief in a future life among the Jews was largely
due to Greek thought; it was one of the main themes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
apocalyptic teaching; but it was also one of the most
prominent tenets of the Pharisees, who developed it from
the Platonic doctrine of the immortality of the soul to a
definite belief in the resurrection of the body. That two
schools of thought, differing in some vital respects, should
nevertheless be in agreement in differing from the normal
teaching of the Old Testament on such a special and peculiarly
important subject as that of the future life, certainly
points to an originally identical parentage. We have laid
stress on the fact that in pre-Maccabæan times the Jewish
nation, as a whole, was more or less influenced by the Hellenistic
spirit; one section of the people would be influenced
in this way, another in that. Thus, as an example, the
<em>Chassidim</em> were influenced by the Hellenistic teaching on
the future life; but the ruling classes were not, they clung
to the old traditional teaching as contained in the Old
Testament. Or again, among the <em>Chassidim</em> were many
who were influenced by the freer and more tolerant atmosphere
of the Greek spirit, agreeing in this with the ruling
classes, but differing from those with whom they were in
some other respects in agreement. So that when, later,
clearly defined parties came into existence, they would not
necessarily differ on <em>all</em> points; and Pharisees and Apocalyptists
agreed as a whole upon the subject of a belief in
the future life, though, as we shall see, various opinions on
certain points concerning the future life were held by the
Apocalyptists.</p>

<p>In another respect we may see an inner probability of
the Pharisees and Apocalyptists having a common ancestry.
The <em>Chassidim</em>, as their name implied, were intensely religiously-minded;
the zeal for the Law of some was one
way in which their eager yearning to do something for God
could find vent; the steadfast gaze upon the world to
come of others was the expression of a longing to be nearer
God. Personal religion was the origin, the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
and the summit of <em>Chassidism</em>. Now when we turn to later
times we are able to see that same intense religious feeling
in the Pharisees and in the Apocalyptists; the expression
of that feeling has, it is true, become exaggerated in each
case; but whether it is the somewhat rank overgrowth
of legalism of the one, or the lurid and often overdrawn
pictures of the eschatological drama of the other, beneath
each is to be discerned real piety. Pharisees and Apocalyptists
differed in many respects, but they were alike
in their zeal for God which they inherited from their common
ancestry.</p>

<p>We are to see, therefore, the beginnings of the Jewish
Apocalyptic Movement in the teaching and literary activity
of devout <em>Chassidim</em>, or better, Apocalyptists, who laboured
in the earlier part of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and probably
earlier.</p>

<p>Our purpose is now first of all to consider a little the
mental attitude of the Apocalyptists in general, their
guiding principles, their chief aims as teachers, and their
personal characteristics. Then we shall examine briefly
the more outstanding doctrines of the Apocalyptic
Literature.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHV_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Apocalyptists</span></h4>

<p>It will be well to draw attention at the outset to a feature
in the teaching of the Apocalyptists which is at first very
disconcerting, namely, their inconsistency of thought and
the variableness to be found in the presentation of some
of their doctrines which not infrequently involves them
in contradictions. The reason of this is not to be sought
simply in the fact that in the Apocalypses the hand of more
than one author is to be discerned; but chiefly because
the minds of individual Apocalyptists were, on the one
hand, saturated with the traditional thoughts and ideas of
the Old Testament, and, on the other, were eagerly absorbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the newer conceptions which the spirit of the age had
brought into being. This occasioned a continual conflict
of thought in their minds; there was a constant endeavour
to harmonize the old and the new; and in consequence
there often resulted a compromise which was illogical and
contradictory.</p>

<p>This inconsistency of teaching is, therefore, not other
than might be expected under the circumstances; nor
did it really affect the great <i lang="fr">rôle</i> that the Apocalyptists
played as the <em>true prophets of the people</em>; in this they followed
in some important particulars the prophets of old, for if
not in the same sense as these the expression of the national
conscience, the Apocalyptists spoke to the hearts of the
people in the name of God. If, upon the whole, their words
were addressed more to individual men than to the nation
as a single whole, it was a welcome sign that the individual
was coming to his own. The Apocalyptists came with a
message of comfort and hope to the God-fearing, bidding
them be of good cheer; for though the world was cruel and
dark, though they were the victims of oppression and
tyranny, though their lot here was a hard one and they
were languishing in adversity, yet this world and all the
fashion of it was passing away; soon, very soon, the bright
future would dawn, the Great Deliverer would come, and
sorrow and sighing would pass away:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The joyous hope that was thus held out must have had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
profound effect upon the many pious Israelites who were
perplexed by the seeming incongruity of things in a world
governed by a righteous and just God. Tempted as they
must often have been to lose faith as well as hope, the
message now brought to them would have strengthened
both. So that the Apocalyptists may be truly described
as upholders of the people’s faith. But they came, too,
with the thunder of denunciation against the godless who
in their abundant prosperity sought only their own pleasure
and cared neither for the honour of God nor for the sorrow
of the godly; for such a future, near approaching, of fearfulness
and terror was predicted by the Apocalyptists:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And when sin and unrighteousness and blasphemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And violence in all kinds of deeds increase,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And they shall be destroyed from under heaven (1 Enoch xcii. 7, 8).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The main concern of the Apocalyptists was thus with the
future, with the world to come, wherein all the inequalities
and incongruities of the present world would be put right.
But from this it followed that most of what they taught
was characterized by a <em>supernatural colouring</em> in which
much that was exaggerated and fantastic was mixed up
with sublime conceptions and eternal truths. They laid
great stress upon the antithesis between this world and
the next, between the <em>Olam ha-zeh</em> (this world), and
the <em>Olam ha-bâ</em> (the world which is to come). Their
view of this world was wholly pessimistic; there was
nothing to be hoped from it; indeed, its badness, entire
and irretrievable, as contrasted with the glorious world
to come wherein no evil might abide, involved the Apocalyptists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
in teaching which was of the nature of dualism. Again,
that which was to come transcended human experience,
so that in the great drama of the end the Apocalyptists
depict man as standing in passive awe in face of the marvellous
and supernatural occurrences which are then to take
place; man’s <i lang="fr">rôle</i> as an active agent ceases; supernatural
beings are God’s instruments in fulfilling His will; the scene is
laid in Heaven, or in the skies, not on earth. The future is
to bring with it a new world-order wherein all things will
be different, the old order is to disappear for ever. In all
this the dominant note which sounds throughout is that of
the <em>supernatural</em>.</p>

<p>At the base of the whole position taken up by the Apocalyptists
in their teaching was a doctrine of <em>determinism</em>,
which must be briefly alluded to, for the recognition of this
is essential to the understanding of the subject. The
Apocalyptists started with the absolute conviction that the
whole course of the world from beginning to end, both as
regards its physical changes, and also in all that concerns
the history of nations, their growth and decline, and of
individuals, good and bad, the innumerable occurrences
of every description and the very moment of their happening—in
a word, the entire constitution and course of the
world and all that is in it, whether regarded as <em>gē</em> (the
physical earth = the Hebrew <em>eretz</em>) or as <em>oikoumenē</em> (the
inhabited world = the Hebrew <em>tēbēl</em>), was in every respect
predetermined by God before all time. The words in
2 (4) Esdras iv. 36, 37 present a belief common to the
Apocalyptists:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For He hath weighed the age in the balance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by number hath He numbered the seasons;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither will He move nor stir things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the measure appointed be fulfilled.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On these words Box well remarks: “The times and periods
of the course of the world’s history have been predetermined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
by God. The numbers of the years have been exactly
fixed. This was a fundamental postulate of the Apocalyptists,
who devoted much of their energy to calculations,
based upon a close study of prophecy, as to the exact period
when history should reach its consummation ... the
underlying idea is predestinarian.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>But all these things are secrets; they can only be known
to certain God-fearing men who have the faculty,
divinely accorded, of peering into the hidden things of
God, and who are thus able to reveal them to their fellow-creatures;
hence the name given to these seers, viz., “revealers,”
or Apocalyptists, because they wrote apocalypses,
“revelations.” It was because the Apocalyptists believed
so firmly in this power that they possessed of looking into
the deep things of God that they claimed to be able to
measure the significance of what had happened in the past
and of what was happening in the present; more especially
they believed that upon the basis of this knowledge they
had the power of foreseeing things to come, and the time
of their coming, and here above all things those which they
regarded as the end of all, to which the whole history of
the world had been tending from the beginning.</p>

<p>But with all their mysticism and other-worldliness, with
all their eager looking forward to the passing of the present
order, the Apocalyptists were not blind to the necessity
of religious life in its practical aspect. They were <em>loyal
to the Law</em>, though not in the Pharisaic sense, laying stress
rather on the spirit of its observance than on carrying it
out literally. The frequent reproaches levelled against
those who do not observe the ordinances of the Law shows
their attitude; for example, in 1 Enoch v. 4 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But ye—ye have not been steadfast, nor done the commandments of the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ye have turned away and have spoken proud and hard words</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With your impure mouths against His greatness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O ye hard-hearted, ye shall find no peace.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again, in xcix. 2 of the same apocalypse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Woe to them that pervert the words of uprightness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And transgress the eternal law (cp. also xcix. 14, Sib. Orac. iii. 276 ff.).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On the other hand, the reward to be accorded to those who
are faithful to the Law is often spoken of; this may be
illustrated from another book, 2 (4) Esdras, of later date,
but in this as in some other points of doctrine the Apocalyptists
believed and taught alike whether belonging to
an early or a late date; in ix. 7-12 of this book the
promise of salvation to those who keep the Law is followed
by a prophecy of woe to those who have ignored it: “And
every one that shall then be saved, and shall be able to
escape on account of his works or his faith by which he
hath believed—such shall survive from the perils aforesaid,
and shall see My salvation in My land, and within My
borders which I have sanctified for Myself eternally. Then
shall they be amazed that now have abused My ways; they
shall abide in the torments which they have spurned and
despised. For all who failed to recognize Me in their lifetime,
although I dealt bountifully with them, and all who
have defied My Law, while they yet had liberty, and, while
place of repentance was still open to them, gave no heed,
but scorned it—these must be brought to know after death
by torment” (cp. vii. 83, viii. 29). The Law is also spoken
of as “the light in which nothing can err” (Syriac Apoc. of
Baruch xix. 3), and in the same book (lix. 2) reference is
made to “the lamp of the eternal Law.” All such passages,
and they could be enormously increased, show that the
Apocalyptists had a high veneration for the Law, although
they did not accept the Pharisaic interpretation of it.</p>

<p>In one respect, however, it may be gathered, the Apocalyptists
were at one with the Pharisees in their method of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
legal observance, and that was in the matter of <em>ascetic
practices</em>; for these are frequently extolled, and are clearly
regarded as highly meritorious. In one book it is stated,
for example, that among those who are written and inscribed
above in heaven are “the spirits of the humble,
and of those who have afflicted their bodies” (1 Enoch
cviii. 7). Elsewhere it is said: “Let us fast for the space
of three days, and on the fourth let us go into a cave
which is in the field, and let us die rather than transgress
the commands of the Lord of lords, the God of our fathers”
(Assumption of Moses ix. 6). In 2 (4) Esdras ascetic
practices are often spoken of, see, e.g., vi. 32, vii. 125, ix. 24,
and often elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, one other point may be mentioned here, namely
the, generally speaking, <em>universalistic attitude</em> of the Apocalyptists;
they are not consistent in this, but normally
they embrace the Gentiles equally with their own nation
in the divine scheme of salvation; the wicked who are
excluded are not restricted to the Gentiles, but the Jews
equally with them shall suffer torment hereafter according
to their deserts. (See on this subject the next section.)</p>

<p>These are, then, briefly the main points which illustrate
the personal characteristics and general mental attitude of
the Apocalyptists. But this will be further illustrated
by glancing at the more important doctrines inculcated
in the Apocalyptic Literature; indeed, one cannot properly
separate the doctrinal teaching of the apocalypses from
the mental standpoint of the writers; but for the sake of
convenience, in enumerating their main points of doctrinal
teaching, we propose to tabulate these in a separate section.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHV_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Doctrinal Teaching of the Apocalyptic
Literature</span></h4>

<p>We have already pointed out that consistency of teaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
is not to be looked for amongst the Apocalyptists as a
whole; it is well to reiterate this here, for in referring to
the main points of doctrine as taught in this literature
examples of this will come before us. It is not our intention
to give an exhaustive account of the doctrinal teaching
of the Apocalyptic Literature; our object is to make some
brief mention of the more specifically characteristic points of
doctrine occurring in this literature.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHV_a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Individualism.</i></h5>

<p>It is one of the marks of Hellenistic influence when we
find that Individualism occupies an important place in
the teaching of some of the books of this literature. This is
markedly the case in the Book of 1 Enoch, where the importance
of the individual is often insisted upon; not the nation
as such, but the righteous and elect, the “plant of righteousness”
as it is called in x. 16, lxxxiv. 6, shall inherit the
eternal reward. Thus it is said in civ. 1: “I swear to you
that in heaven the angels remember you for good before
the glory of the Great One; and your names are written
before the glory of the Great One.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The redemption of
the world is to be brought about through the righteous
and elect individuals, “the eternal seed-plant.” This
is one of the dominating thoughts of this book, and also finds
expression in others of this literature; it is one, as Friedländer
says, which did not emanate from Pharisaic soil,
but was a product of Jewish Hellenism.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In accordance
with this, individual responsibility is strongly emphasized;
a very pointed passage in this connection is 2 (4) Esdras
vii. 102-105, where the seer asks the angel: “If I have
found favour in thy sight, show me, thy servant, this
also: whether in the Day of Judgement the righteous shall
be able to intercede for the ungodly, or to entreat the Most
High in their behalf—fathers for sons, sons for parents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
brothers for brothers, kinsfolk for their nearest, friends
for their dearest.” And the reply of the angel is: “The
Day of Judgement is decisive, and displays unto all the
seal of truth. Even as now a father may not send a son,
or a son his father, or a master his slave, or a friend his
dearest, that in his stead he may be ill, or sleep, or eat, or be
healed, so shall none then pray for another on that Day,
neither shall one lay a burden on another, for then every
one shall bear his own righteousness or unrighteousness.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>


<h5 id="PI_CHV_b">(<i>b</i>) <i>Particularism and Universalism.</i></h5>

<p>Here we have a good example of the inconsistency of
teaching already referred to. The traditional belief of the
Jewish nation being the peculiar treasure of God asserts
itself in spite of the broader outlook inspired by Hellenistic
influence. The former attitude is seen, for example, in
the Assumption of Moses i. 12, where Moses says to Joshua:
“He hath created the world on behalf of His people.”
In 2 (4) Esdras, again, we have the following: “But as
for the other nations, which are descended from Adam,
Thou hast said that they are nothing, and that they are
like spittle; and Thou hast likened the abundance of
them to a drop falling from a bucket. And now, O Lord,
behold, these nations which are reputed as nothing lord
it over us and crush us. But we, Thy people, whom Thou
hast called Thy first-born, Thy only-begotten, Thy beloved,
are given up into their hands. If the world has indeed
been created for our sakes why do we not enter into
possession of our world?” (vii. 56-59). But though other
passages of similar import could be given from most of the
books of this literature, the particularistic attitude is not
the normal or usual one; far more frequent are those passages
which express a wider universalistic view; one or two instances
may be given: in 1 Enoch x. 21 it is said that “all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
children of men shall become righteous, and all nations
shall offer adoration and shall praise Me, and all shall
worship Me”; in xlviii. 4 it is said of the Son of Man that
“He shall be the Light of the Gentiles” (see also xi. 1, 2,
xlix. 1, l. 2-5, xc. 30, xci. 14, Sib. Orac., iii. 702-726, Syr.
Apoc. of Baruch xiv. 19, etc.); so, too, in the Testament
of the Twelve Patriarchs, Levi ii. 11: “And by thee and
Judah shall the Lord appear among men, saving every
race of men.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in quite a number of
passages in several of these apocalyptic books a blending
of these two attitudes seems to find expression; thus, in
the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, Levi xiv. 3, 4,
Israel is regarded as superior to all other nations, but the
salvation of the latter is awaited, and Israel is to be the
means thereof: “My children, be ye pure, as the heaven is
purer than the earth; and ye who are the lights of Israel, shall
be as the sun and moon. What will the Gentiles do
if ye be darkened through transgression? Yea, curses
will come upon your race, and the light which was given
through the Law to lighten you and every man, ye shall
desire to destroy, and teach your commandments contrary
to the ordinances of God.” Not essentially different is the
thought contained in the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch
lxvii. 5: “And at that time, after a little interval, Zion will
again be builded, and its offerings will again be restored,
and the priests will return to their ministry, and also the
Gentiles will come to glorify it.” This teaching was not
merely theoretical, it expressed what the Apocalyptists,
urged on by the influence of the Hellenistic spirit, were
actually striving to bring about; they desired to make
Judaism a world-religion which could be embraced by all
the Gentiles; hence the missionary propaganda which
they initiated and carried out, and of which a large part
of their literary activity formed the expression. According<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
to them the Jewish Church was to consist of those
who were righteous, no matter what their nationality
might be; and if one, though he were a Jew, was not godly,
he was not regarded as a member of that Church. Outside
of Palestine, as well as in many parts within the land,
Jew and Gentile were constantly being brought into personal
touch with one another, man with man; and many
Jews came to learn that the distinction between the “people
of God” and the “heathen world” was a wrong one, unfitting
in the sight of God, unjust to men. Hence arose
the apprehension of the true distinction to be drawn among
men, a distinction between the righteous and the ungodly,
irrespective altogether of nationality or race; and it is
this distinction which finds such abundant expression in
the Apocalyptic Literature. This religious conception
regarding humanity resulted, in the natural course, in the
desire to proclaim the name of the true and one God to
all men so that all might have the chance of knowing Him.
The Apocalyptists, inspired in large measure by the teaching
of some of the greatest prophets, were therefore the great
missionaries at this period; and this was the combined
result of the universalistic attitude brought about by
the influence of the Hellenistic spirit and the fuller apprehension
and meaning of the teaching of prophets such as
those who wrote the latter half of the Book of Isaiah and
the Book of Jonah.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHV_c">(<i>c</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Messiah.</i></h5>

<p>We need not go into all the details of Messianic teaching
given in this literature; much of it is similar to that found
in the Old Testament and in the Apocrypha; it will be
sufficient if we point out what is more specifically characteristic.
The most important point upon which to lay stress
is the transcendental character of the Messiah. In 1 Enoch
the Messiah appears as One Who is divine, for He has His
place upon the throne of God:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In accordance with this divine character of the Messiah is
the teaching of His pre-existence before the world began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, before the sun and the signs were created,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the stars of the heaven were made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His name was named before the Lord of Spirits (xlviii. 3, cp. verse 6).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This teaching is by no means confined to the Book of
Enoch; in the Sibylline Oracles v. 414 ff., for example, it is
said in reference to the Messiah that “there hath come from the
plains of heaven a Blessed Man with the Sceptre in His hand
which God hath committed to His clasp; and He hath won fair
dominion over all, and hath restored to all the good the
wealth which the former men took.” In the Testament
of the Twelve Patriarchs, Judah xxiv. 1 it is said: “No
sin shall be found in Him”; and in Levi xviii. 10, 11 are
the striking words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And He shall open the gates of paradise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shall remove the threatening sword against Adam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And He shall give to the saints to eat from the tree of life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the spirit of holiness shall be on them.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 2 (4) Esdras the Messiah is likewise similarly portrayed,
though in some passages he appears as purely human (see
below, chap. IX. § (<i>e</i>)). In some other apocalypses the
Messiah is conceived of as a man pure and simple; but
the account given above is the more characteristic of the
Apocalyptic Literature taken as a whole.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHV_d">(<i>d</i>) <i>The doctrine of the Future Life.</i></h5>

<p>Two outstanding doctrines come into consideration here:
the doctrine of the immortality of the spirit, and the doctrine
of the resurrection of the body. The causes, humanly
speaking, whereby one led on to the other, were, firstly, the
belief in a final retribution which the existence of a just and
righteous God rendered necessary; and, secondly, innate
materialistic conceptions which resulted in causing men to
impute to the spirit what belongs properly to the body.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
To dwell for a moment on the first point; the clearest
illustration of it is found in the Book of 1 Enoch, where in cii.
6-8 the following words are put into the mouth of sinners:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">As we die, so die the righteous,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what benefit do they reap for their deeds?</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold, even as we, so do they die in grief and darkness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And what have they more than we?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From henceforth we are equal.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And what will they receive, and what will they see for ever?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold, they too have died,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And henceforth for ever shall they see no light.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This evidently represents what was in effect actually believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and said by many; and the normal teaching of the Old
Testament bore out the truth of it. But if it were true how
could God’s righteousness and justice be vindicated? So
the Apocalyptists taught a doctrine of retribution much
in advance of anything to be found in the Old Testament,
a doctrine which involved belief in immortality, and
here they were indebted to Hellenistic influence, very
different from the traditional Sheol-conception. This
doctrine is nowhere more clearly set forth than in 1 Enoch
ciii. 1-8. The passage is somewhat lengthy, but in view of
its importance it will be well to quote it in full:</p>

<p class="fs80">Now, therefore, I swear to you, the righteous, by the glory of the
Great and Honoured and Mighty One in dominion, and by His
greatness I swear to you:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>It will be noticed that in this passage it is only the spirit
which is spoken of as living in the world to come, so that
nothing more than the immortality of the spirit is taught;
a teaching considerably in advance of the normal teaching
of the Old Testament, but yet it does not go beyond belief
in the immortality of the spirit. On the other hand, the
passage contains expressions of a materialistic kind incompatible
with purely spiritual conceptions; so that a reflective
mind must sooner or later have been led to the
fuller doctrine of the resurrection of the body if his teaching
was to be logical.</p>

<p>But here another element comes into consideration.
Conceptions regarding the Messianic Kingdom varied, and
the subject we are discussing was closely connected with
those variations; for as long as the Messianic Kingdom
was conceived of as existing on this earth the teaching on
the life hereafter, i.e. within the Messianic Kingdom, was
bound to tend towards a bodily existence then. But when
the Kingdom came to be conceived of as existing in the
heavens, materialistic ideas receded, and more spiritual
ones found expression. There seem, therefore, to have been
three stages of conception regarding the state of man’s
nature in the future life: first of all a development of the
Old Testament Sheol-conception which resulted in the belief
of the immortality of the spirit<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>; then with the expectation
of the Messianic Kingdom of eternal duration on this earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
came the belief in the resurrection of the body; and, lastly,
when the Kingdom of Heaven was conceived of as eternal
in the Heavens above, it was the resurrection of the spirit
that was taught.</p>

<p>Variation of teaching is also found in the Apocalyptic
Literature regarding those who are to attain to the future
life; sometimes it is taught that all the Israelites, good and
bad, shall rise, those to inherit bliss, these to suffer torment;
the Gentiles are not considered. At other times only the
good Israelites are to rise; while it is also taught, though more
rarely, that all mankind shall rise, including therefore the
Gentiles; the righteous rise to eternal life, the wicked to
eternal torment. An intermediate period of waiting between
death and the resurrection is also taught, the wicked
being in Hades, the righteous in Paradise. But sometimes
there is no mention of an intermediate state, the resurrection
following immediately after death.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These, then, constitute the most important doctrines
concerning which the Apocalyptic Literature has something
specific to teach. The doctrine of God does not differ
materially from anything that is taught in the Old Testament
and in the Apocrypha, and the same applies to the
doctrine of Sin; the doctrine of Wisdom will receive consideration
in <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX</a>. The Angelology and Demonology
of this Literature certainly show considerable development
owing to Persian influence; but these two subjects are
not of sufficient importance for present purposes to merit
any detailed treatment.</p>

<p>For some account of the books of this literature see
<a href="#PI_CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHV_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>In discussing the beginnings of the Apocalyptic Movement
a consideration of the different thought-tendencies in
Palestine prior to the Maccabæan struggle is necessary.
The Jewish nation as a whole had come under the influence
of the Hellenistic spirit, though not all were Hellenistically
inclined. A minority, who clung tenaciously to the rigid
observance of the Law, was known as the “Pious ones,”
or <em>Chassidim</em>. But these <em>Chassidim</em> were of two types;
there were among them those who became the Apocalyptists,
and there were also among them those who, later, developed
into the party of the Pharisees. Thus both Apocalyptists
and Pharisees acknowledged a common descent, i.e. from
the <em>Chassidim</em>.</p>

<p>The teaching of the Apocalyptists is on more than one
subject inconsistent; this is mainly due to the fact that
their minds were, on the one hand, saturated with the
traditional thoughts and ideas of the Old Testament, while
on the other hand they were eagerly absorbing the newer
conceptions bred of the spirit of the age. Nevertheless, the
Apocalyptists were the true prophets of the people, to
whom they brought a message of comfort and hope by
telling of the new world which was soon to come; to the
ungodly they addressed words of stern warning. The teaching
of the Apocalyptists dealt mainly with the world to come,
and most of what they taught was characterized by its
supernatural colouring. They held strongly that all things
had been predestined by God before all time. In spite of
much mysticism and a gaze concentrated on that which
was to come, the Apocalyptists were loyal to the Law,
though not in the Pharisaic sense, the spirit of its observance
being regarded as more important than obedience to the
letter. Normally the Apocalyptists were universalists
rather than particularists, though in this they were inconsistent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>The main points in the doctrinal teaching of the Apocalyptic
Literature are: Individualism, the importance of the
individual being strongly emphasized; the inclusion of the
Gentiles in the divine plan of salvation; the transcendental
character of the Messiah; and the teaching concerning the
future life; in this latter inconsistency is found, sometimes
the resurrection of the body is taught, at other times only
the immortality of the soul; there is also variety of teaching
on the subject of those who are to attain to the future life
and their lot there.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-capy">It is important that we should try, as far as possible, to
present the available <em>data</em> concerning the Scribes
in their chronological order; that would, of course, be
desirable in any case, but it is doubly so when, as here, a
clear statement of the development of the scribal class
and its activities may be a help in understanding some of
the difficult questions which will come before us in dealing
with the Sadducees and Pharisees. We shall, therefore,
state the evidence chronologically, as far as may be, making
our deductions as we proceed.</p>

<h4><span class="hidden">The Scribes</span></h4>
<h5 id="PI_CHVI_a">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Old Testament data.</i></h5>

<p>First as to the use of the term “Scribe” = <em>Sôphēr</em> in
Hebrew, and is used in the sense of “secretary” or the
like; in 2 Samuel viii. 17, e.g., among David’s officials
are reckoned “Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech
the son of Abiathar, who were priests; and Seraiah, who
was scribe” (cp. 2 Sam. xx. 25; 2 Kings xviii. 18, etc.).
As a royal official he had various duties; he acted as treasurer,
according to 2 Kings xii. 11, 2 Chronicles xxiv. 11, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
in some military capacity, according to 2 Kings xxv. 19,
Jeremiah lii. 25; in Psalm xlv. 2 a <em>Sôphēr</em> is clearly one
who writes (“My tongue is the pen of a ready writer”
[<em>Sôphēr</em>]); and, finally, in Esther iii. 12, viii. 9, he occupies
the place of the Persian king’s secretary who writes
out decrees. With one exception (Ps. xlv. 2), in all these
passages the Scribe is spoken of as a royal official; they are,
therefore, only important for us here as showing that the
ideas of counting and writing are connected with the term
<em>Sôphēr</em>; and these are exactly the meanings conveyed by
the root.</p>

<p>The three next passages, which give some <em>data</em> regarding
the office of the Scribe, have a special importance because
they are pre-exilic—</p>

<p>Jeremiah viii. 8, 9: “How do ye say, We are wise,
and the Law of the Lord is with us? But, behold, the
false pen of the Scribes hath wrought falsely. The wise
men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; lo, they
have rejected the word of the Lord; and what manner of
wisdom is in them?”</p>

<p>Jeremiah xviii. 18: “Then said they, Come and let us
devise devices against Jeremiah; for the Law shall not
perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor
the word from the prophet.”</p>

<p>Jeremiah xxxvi.: This chapter is too long to quote in
full; it tells us of Baruch, the Scribe, who wrote down
Jeremiah’s words “upon a roll of a book”; it also mentions
Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, the Scribe, who had his
chamber “in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate
of the Lord’s house” (verse 10); further, mention is also
made of Elishama the Scribe, who had his chamber in the
king’s house (verse 12); Elishama was clearly a royal official.</p>

<p>From these passages we gather that Scribes were in existence
before the Exile, that they claimed to be wise, and
that they regarded themselves as authorities on the Law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of the Lord; they are censured by Jeremiah with having
“wrought falsely,” and the context points to this as being
connected with the “Law of the Lord”; what precisely
is referred to is not easy to determine, but the point of
importance for us is that the pre-exilic Scribes were occupied
with the Law; if they come under the lash of Jeremiah
they do not differ in this respect from the wise men, nor
yet from the priests and the prophets (see viii. 10). In
Jeremiah xxxvi. mention is made of Scribes in influential
positions; but in addition to these there is Baruch, who
belongs to a different category of Scribe, for he makes
copies of what are clearly regarded as sacred writings (see
verses 24, 25). From the meagre evidence we possess there
is not much to be gathered; but we may perhaps be justified
in saying that already in pre-exilic times the term “Scribes”
was beginning to be used as a technical term in the limited
sense of their being those whose special duty it was to make
copies of the Law in the form in which it then existed. But
in saying that the term “Scribes” was used in a technical
sense already in this pre-exilic period we must very strongly
emphasize that this is to be understood in an entirely
different sense from that in which it was used as a technical
term in post-exilic times. There is a world of difference
between the Scribe who is the more or less officially accredited
copier of the text of the Law or other Scriptures, and the
Scribe who also interprets the Law, teaches it to the people,
and in whom is vested the judicial power of enforcing its
decrees. In each case “Scribe” may be used as a technical
term while connoting two very different things.</p>

<p>Further, from the second of the passages quoted above
we see that three distinct classes are mentioned, viz., the
priests, the wise men or <em>Chakamim</em>, and the prophets.
There can be no doubt that these three were in existence
long before Scribes in the technical sense were heard of;
with the prophets we are not concerned here, for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
activity lay in a different sphere altogether; but we must
try and get some clear ideas upon the subject of the relationship
between the Scribes and the priests on the one hand,
and the Scribes and the <em>Chakamim</em> on the other.</p>

<p>Originally the priests alone were concerned with the
Law; but the Law contained, broadly speaking, two
elements, the ritual and the moral; the former of these
was more especially the concern of the priests; but the
latter had a wider interest, and many of the <em>Chakamim</em>
as well as the priests occupied themselves with it. When
the Scribes arose—it is not possible to say precisely when
this was, but it was before the Exile—they did not, as a
body, restrict themselves to the study of one or other
aspect of the Law, but, according to their bent, some gave
more particular attention to the study of the ritual Law,
others to the moral Law; so that among the types of scribe
there appeared the priest-scribe, such as Ezra, and the
wisdom-scribe, such as was Ben-Sira in later times. But
the <em>Chakamim</em>, as a class, still remained, no less than the
priests, each occupying themselves with their particular
study, as they had done before the Scribes came into existence.
In course of time, and through Ezra’s influence,
the power of the Scribes greatly increased, and they became
the most influential leaders among the people; and by
the time of the Maccabæan struggle their activities were
wholly and exclusively absorbed in the study and teaching
of the Law, both ritual and moral, written and oral. But
we have anticipated, and must now turn to the evidence
of the post-exilic books.</p>

<p>In Ezra vii. the following verses are important: “Ezra
... was a ready scribe in the Law of Moses, which the
Lord, the God of Israel, had given” (verse 6). “Ezra had
set his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and
to teach in Israel statutes and judgements” (verse 10).
“... Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
words of the commandments of the Lord, and of His statutes
to Israel....” “Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law
of the God of heaven” (verses 11, 12, 21). According to
vii. 25, Artaxerxes gives the following instructions to Ezra:
“And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in
thine hand, appoint magistrates and judges, which may
judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as
know the laws of thy God, and teach ye him that knoweth
them not.”</p>

<p>The whole of Nehemiah viii.-x. is important for our
present subject; we draw special attention to the following
passages: “Ezra the scribe” is asked by the people to
bring the book of the Law of Moses in order that it might
be read to them; it then continues: “And Ezra the priest
brought the Law before the congregation, both men and
women, and all that could hear with understanding....
And he read therein before the broad place that was before
the water-gate from early morning until mid-day, in the
presence of the men and the women, and of those that could
understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive
unto the book of the Law” (viii. 2, 3). In viii. 7-9, the
names of thirteen men are enumerated who, together
with the Levites, “caused the people to understand the
Law. And they read in the book, in the Law of God,
interpreting it; and they gave the sense, and caused (the
people) to understand the reading. And Nehemiah, which
was the Tirshatha,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and Ezra the priest the scribe, and
the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people,
This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not,
nor weep.” Further, in viii. 13-15, it is said: “And on
the second day were gathered together the heads of the
fathers’ houses of all the people, the priests and the Levites,
unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words
of the Law. And they found written in the Law, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
that the Lord had commanded by Moses that the children
of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh
month ...”; then follows the account of how the people
were to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>

<p>These passages show that whatever may have been the
scribal activity before the Exile, an altogether new position
was assigned to the Law and its observances by the scribe
Ezra.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The Law now begins to be the central pre-occupation
of the Scribes under the guidance of Ezra and
Nehemiah, the former of whom is the scribe <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>.
The priests and Levites are associated with the scribe Ezra,
and presumably with the scribes in general; but we know
from later history that the study of the Law soon became the
special concern of the Scribes almost to the exclusion of the
priests. Noteworthy is the stress laid on teaching the Law
to the people; and a new element of far-reaching importance
seems to be adumbrated in Nehemiah viii. 8, where it is
said that the teachers of Law “read in the book, in the
Law of God, interpreting it; and they gave the sense,
and caused (the people) to understand the reading.” It
is interesting to note that the Hebrew root for “to interpret”
here (<em>p-r-sh</em>) is the same as that from which the
word Pharisee comes; we shall draw attention to this
again later.</p>

<p>One or two passages of later date must also be noted,
for they are not without interest, and shed further light
on our subject:</p>

<p>1 Chronicles ii. 55: Among various genealogical enumerations
occurs that of “the families of scribes which
dwelt at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Sucathites. These are the Kenites that came of Hammath,
the father of the house of Rechab.” From this we gather,
first, that the scribal office was inherited, and from Jeremiah
xxxvi. 10-12 we may assume that this was also the case in
pre-exilic times, for both Michaiah, and his father Gemariah,
who was the son of Shaphan the scribe, seem to be closely
associated with the scribes, and were presumably themselves
scribes. Another point to be noted from the passage
quoted is that some families of the scribes were connected
with the house of Rechab; now the Rechabites were
ascetics (see Jer. xxxv. 6-10), and it is possible that when,
in later days, the Pharisees made a point of practising
asceticism,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> they were following an early tradition in
principle though the actual practices had become different
with the changed conditions of life.</p>

<p>2 Chronicles xxxiv. 13: This passage is referred to because
it says that some of the Levites were scribes, which again
implies association with the priests.</p>

<p>Daniel v. 26-28: Here we have an example of text and
interpretation which, so far as the principle is concerned,
is according to the scribal method.</p>

<p>We have now to examine some Old Testament evidence
of another kind, and as this is calculated to throw light on
the subsequent history of the scribal movement and its
developments it deserves careful consideration.</p>

<p>From a number of indications to be found in the Books
of Ezra and Nehemiah it is evident that from the very
commencement of the settlement of the exiles in Palestine
differences arose between them and the Israelites whom
they found there on their return. There seem to have been
several causes for these differences; but what largely lay
at the bottom of them was the contention of the returned
exiles that they alone represented the true Israelites;
those who had been left in the land had become mixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
with the heathen<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> by living among them and intermarrying
with them, and were therefore not regarded as true Israelites.
But more than this; it would seem that among the exiles
themselves there were some who belonged to the priesthood,
but that this was denied by the leaders among the exiles;
this is gathered from Ezra ii. 61-63, where the enumeration
of some priestly families is given concerning whom it is
said: “These sought their register among those that were
reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore
were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not
eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with
Urim and with Thummim.” Among the exiled people,
too, were some who “could not show their fathers’ houses
and their seed, whether they were of Israel” (Ezra ii. 39).
Thus both those who had been living in Palestine, and some
of those who returned with the exiles, had a grievance.
This was greatly aggravated when Zerubbabel refused the
help of any but those whom he considered true Israelites
in the building of the temple (Ezra iv. 1-5): “... Then
the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
of Judah, and troubled them in building....” (cp. Neh.
ii. 19, iv. 1 ff.).</p>

<p>A more far-reaching cause of division was that of marriage
with foreigners, especially with Samaritans, who were
with justice regarded as heathen by the bulk of the returned
exiles; in Ezra ix. 1, 2, we read: “... the princes drew
near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests
and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the
peoples of the lands.... For they have taken of their
daughters for themselves and for their sons; so that the
holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the
lands. Yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
chief in this trespass” (cp. Neh. xiii. 23, 24). That, as
indicated in these last words, it was the aristocracy, i.e. the
high-priestly families, who were most forward in contracting
foreign alliances and who were in favour of intercourse with
non-Jews generally, is shown further by such passages as
Nehemiah vi. 17-19: “Moreover, in those days the nobles
of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters
of Tobiah came unto them. For there were many in Judah
sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah
the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the
daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife. Also
they spake of his good deeds before me and reported my
words to him.” And again Nehemiah xiii. 28: “And one
of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high-priest, was
son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite.” Very significant,
too, is the long passage Ezra x. 18-44; this contains a list
of those who had married strange wives; first are mentioned
the sons of the priests, among these a few had put away their
wives (verses 18, 19), but the list, as it continues, mentions
those priests who did not do so (verses 20-22); then follow
the names of Levites, singers, and porters, then of Israelites,
who “had taken strange wives; and some of them had
wives by whom they had children” (verse 44). The attempts
of Ezra and Nehemiah to stop these alliances and to put
an end to the intercourse between the Jews and those whom
they regarded as heathen were thus not wholly successful;
and this is further borne out by several passages which
reveal the resistance offered, e.g. Ezra x. 15: “But Jonathan
the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
stood up against this matter; and Meshullam and Shabbethai
the Levite helped them.” Again, in Nehemiah vi.
10-14 the influence of Sanballat and Tobiah upon many of
those who lived in Jerusalem, and the existence of a party
there opposed to Ezra, is plainly indicated; among those
belonging to this party there are mentioned Shemaiah,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the prophetess Noadiah, “and the rest of the prophets”
(cp. also xiii. 4 ff.; Mal. ii. 10-16).</p>

<p>From all these indications it is not difficult to see that
the elements for the formation of a distinct party in opposition
to the <i lang="fr">régime</i> of Ezra and Nehemiah were present
from the very beginning of the return from the Exile.
For some considerable time, no doubt, the influence of
Ezra succeeded in suppressing, though not in quenching,
the opposition which he met with; but two diverging
tendencies became rooted among sections of the people, and in
course of time bore fruit in the formation of distinct parties.</p>

<p>The distinguishing notes of these two tendencies can be
discerned without difficulty; on the one hand there were,
as can be seen from the quotations given above, the members
of the aristocracy, i.e., the high-priestly families, who were
friendly disposed to those of semi-Israelite and even non-Israelite
origin. They were, from the point of view of their
adversaries, lax concerning the observance of the Law (see,
e.g., Neh. xiii. 15 ff.), though not necessarily antagonistic to
it, but only to the Ezra conception of it; they could, for
example, show that their foreign marriages were not contrary
to the Law, while Ezra’s requirements went beyond
the Law. On the other hand, there was Ezra, and his
followers, strongly adverse to any intercourse between Jews
and non-Jews, and painfully scrupulous regarding the
minute observance of the Law (see, e.g., Neh. x. 28 ff.).</p>

<p>Here, therefore, were the tendencies already in existence
which, as time went on, continued to develop until they
became the crystallized tenets of definitely opposed parties,
whose watchwords were Universalism <i lang="la">versus</i> Particularism,
and whose attitude towards the Law differed in this respect,
that the Universalists interpreted it in a limited sense,
while the Particularists insisted on a laborious observance
of it in all its minute details, which became greatly increased
by their methods of interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>The process of the development of these tendencies can
be seen in some of the books of the Old Testament; for
example, in the Book of Haggai (ii. 10 ff.) we have indications
of the importance laid upon minute legal observances
by the priests, with whom, as already pointed out,
the Scribes were associated; in the Book of Jonah, on the
other hand, universalism is throughout the dominant note.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVI_b">(<i>b</i>) <i>The Apocrypha data.</i></h5>

<p>The classical passage in the books of the Apocrypha concerning
our present subject is Ecclesiasticus xxxix. 1-11,
where the ideal scribe is described; in the passage which
precedes this Ben-Sira insists upon the need of leisure for
a scribe if he is to devote himself to the acquisition of true
wisdom; he shows that the labourer and the artisan, while
indispensable to society, are necessarily too much occupied
with their callings to give any time to higher things. Then
he continues:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">1. Not so he that applieth himself to the fear of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">And to set his mind upon the Law of the Most High;</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Who searcheth out the wisdom of all the ancients,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">And is occupied with the prophets of old;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">2. Who heedeth the discourses of men of renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">And entereth into the deep things of parables;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">3. Searcheth out the hidden meaning of proverbs,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">8. He himself declareth wise instruction,</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">And glorieth in the Law of the Lord....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first thing that must strike us here is that according to
Ben-Sira there is no difference between a scribe and a
wise man, the two are synonymous (verse 1).<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
thing to note is that Ben-Sira recognizes two sources of the
scribe’s knowledge, the study of these is what constitutes
the scribal activity; the first is described in verse 1, viz.,
the Law of the Most High, the wisdom of the ancients, and
the prophets of old; that is to say, the Pentateuch, the
Wisdom books, and the prophetical books.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The second
is described in verses 2, 3, viz., discourses of men of renown,
deep things of parables, hidden meaning of proverbs,
and dark sayings of parables; it is difficult to see to what
these things can refer unless it is to the discussions, proverbs
and aphorisms of the kind which abound in Ben-Sira’s book.
That they cannot refer to the oral Law is clear enough from
the description itself; for the oral Law cannot be said to
have consisted of discourses, hidden meaning of proverbs,
or dark sayings of parables. Ben-Sira, though a scribe,
has nothing to say about an oral Law, though he must have
known of its existence; yet he has a great veneration for the
Law, there are abundant indications of that in his book.
We have, moreover, seen <ins class="corr" id="tn-124" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'that three are'">
that there are</ins> strong grounds for
believing that an oral Law was in existence long before the
time of Ben-Sira (<i lang="la">circa</i> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200), and the evidence of somewhat
later times points in the same direction. We are,
therefore, forced to the conclusion that Ben-Sira represents
a type of scribe who venerated the Law as written, but repudiated
the oral Law. Further, though Ben-Sira was a good
Jew, the Hellenistic influences which are to be found in his
book and his generally broader mental outlook make him in
some respects the antithesis of Ezra. Ben-Sira thus seems
to belong to those, of whom we have made mention above,
whose tendency was in an universalistic direction and who
could venerate the Law without feeling bound by the inferences
which might be drawn from its interpretation.</p>

<p>The evidence of the Prologue to the Greek translation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Ecclesiasticus, some sixty years later, points also to a veneration
of the Law, but without making any reference to the
oral Law, although it is probable that scribes are in the
mind of the writer of the Prologue when he speaks of
“readers” and “lovers of learning who must be able to
profit them which are without [i.e. the laity, most likely]
both by speaking and writing.” The Prologue thus corroborates
what we learn from the book itself.</p>

<p>Before coming to 1 Maccabees, which is the next book
to give evidence on the subject of the Scribes, a word
must be said about the <em>Assidæans</em>, or <em>Chassidim</em>.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> By
these are meant those “Pious” ones, frequently mentioned
in some of the later Psalms (e.g., cxlix. 1-9, and elsewhere),
who clung tenaciously to the Law, both written and oral,
when, in the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards, many of the Jews
were becoming lax owing, largely, to Hellenistic influences.
They were animated by a strong antipathy towards everyone
who was Hellenistically inclined; they were legalists
in the strictest sense of the word, and particularists. Although
in existence beforehand, it was only during the
Maccabæan struggle that they commenced to play an
important <i lang="fr">rôle</i> in the political life of the nation. The
importance of the <em>Chassidim</em> for our present study is that
they are identified with one type of the scribes in 1 Maccabees
vii. 12, 13, viz.: “And there was gathered together
unto Alcimus<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and Bacchides<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> a company of scribes to
seek for justice; and the <em>Chassidim</em> were the first among
the children of Israel that sought peace of them [i.e., of
Alcimus and Bacchides].” The evidence of this book
appears at first sight to be conflicting, for in the passage just
cited they appear as the peaceful party, while in ii. 43, 44
they are described as warlike.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It is probable, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
that these descriptions both witness to the true facts of the
case; for the natural inclination of these students and
strict observers of the Law would clearly lie in the direction
of peace; but as soon as they realized that the cherished
object of their existence was imperilled, fighting became a
necessity. It must be remembered that the <em>Chassidim</em>
and the Maccabees are in no sense to be identified; they
were both champions of the Law, and both the enemies of
Hellenistic Jews; but the Maccabees were patriots primarily,
while the <em>Chassidim</em> were legalists, and, provided
they were left in peace to follow their legal studies and
observances, it was of no great moment to them whether
their nation was independent or a subject-race.</p>

<p>In the Book of Judith, although the Scribes are never mentioned,
many details of what were really the results of their
activity are to be found; but as these are spoken of in
Part II in the account there given of the Book of Judith
(§ iii.), we need not make any further reference to the subject
here.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVI_c">(<i>c</i>) <i>Some further particulars.</i></h5>

<p>One or two other points regarding the Scribes may be
briefly mentioned. As exponents of the Law and of the
Scriptures generally the Scribes were as a matter of course
greatly occupied with the Hebrew text of these; they thus
became, quite apart from their other duties, such as making
copies of the Scriptures, the guardians of the text of Scripture,
and upon them devolved the further duty of the
fixing and the preservation of the Biblical text. This very
important function marks them out as the beginners of the
textual criticism of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>A further practical duty which the study and exposition
of the Law brought with it was that of administering it.
The Scribe was a lawyer; in the Gospels the two terms are
synonymous, for which reason they never occur together.
It was as administrators of the Law that the Scribes were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
represented in the Sanhedrin at Jerusalem; here they sat
as judges who assisted in the passing of sentences on those
who had broken the Law.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>After definite parties had come into existence the Scribes
belonged, in the main, to the Pharisaic party; but there was
no reason against some of them being members of the
Sadducæan party; this is, indeed, implied in such passages
as Mark ii. 16; Luke v. 30; Acts xxiii. 9.</p>

<p>That which constituted the difference between the Scribes
and the Pharisees was briefly this: the Scribes handed down
the traditional, i.e. the oral, Law as well as the written
Law, and explained it; the Pharisees carried out in actual
practice what was thus prescribed. This, of course, does
not mean to say that the Scribes did not also strictly observe
the legal enactments; but that their special duties
constituted them a class distinct from the Pharisees is
clear from the way in which they are differentiated in the
New Testament, for there we read of the “Scribes of the
Pharisees” (Mark ii. 16; Acts xxiii. 9), and of “the Pharisees
and their scribes” (Luke v. 30), showing clearly that
the Scribes were distinct from the Pharisees.</p>

<p>The natural sequel to any account of the Scribes is a
consideration of the Pharisees; with these, in conjunction
with the Sadducees, we shall deal in the next chapter.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVI_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>From the Old Testament <em>data</em> we gather that there were
Scribes who were occupied with the written Law in pre-exilic
times, though they arose long subsequently to the
priests, the prophets, and the <em>Chakamim</em>, or wise men;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
but the pre-exilic scribe was of a very different kind from
the scribe of later times. Ezra was not only the first scribe
in the later sense of the word, but was also the inaugurator
of the scribal system as generally understood.</p>

<p>An important point to notice in the activity of the Scribes
in the earliest post-exilic period is that as teachers of the
Law they interpreted it to the people.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the return from the Captivity
differences arose between the returned exiles and those
whom they found in Palestine on their return. These
differences reveal the existence of two diverging tendencies
among many of the people, the distinguishing notes of which
were particularism and rigid legalism on the one hand, and
universalism coupled with a less strict interpretation of
legal requirements on the other. Ezra and those who
followed him were the upholders of the former, the high-priestly
party and their followers of the latter tendency.
The process of development in either direction can be discerned
in some of the later Old Testament books.</p>

<p>In the Apocrypha we learn from Ecclesiasticus that a
type of scribe had arisen whose energies were directed
towards the acquisition of wisdom which he was concerned
to impart to others; this type of scribe, while venerating
the Law, sympathized with the universalistic rather than
with the particularistic attitude. Belonging to a slightly
later time are the <em>Chassidim</em>, or “Pious ones,” who were strict
legalists and of a particularistic tendency, though they were
not patriots in the sense that the typical Maccabæans were.
The <em>Chassidim</em> are spoken of in connexion with the Scribes.
We are, therefore, led to the conclusion that before the
middle of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> two types of scribe were
in existence, the wisdom scribe, and the more particularly
legal scribe. Concerning these latter, who are to be regarded
as the Scribes in the strictly technical sense and who became
closely associated with the Pharisaic party, the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
further points may be noted: upon them devolved, in
addition to other duties, the guardianship of the text of
Scripture. They were, further, the administrators of the
Law, and were represented in the Sanhedrin, and thus sat
as judges and assisted in the passing of sentences on those
who had broken the Law.</p>

<h4 id="PI_CHVII_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Meaning of the Terms “Pharisees” and
“Sadducees”</span></h4>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_a">(<i>a</i>) <i>Pharisees.</i></h5>

<p class="drop-capy">It is usually held that the name Pharisee is derived from
a root (<em>p-r-sh</em>) meaning to “separate,” and that the
Pharisees took their name, or received it, in order to emphasize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
their separation from the common people. This
is, on the face of it, difficult to accept when one remembers
that the Pharisees were the champions of the oral Law,
which was, in the first instance, based upon popular traditional
custom. The inappropriateness of this explanation
becomes glaring when it is considered that everything
we know about the Pharisees shows us that so far from
separating themselves from the people this is exactly what
they did not do; they arose from the ranks of the people,
and unlike the aristocratic Sadducees, were always among
the people, as the Gospels show. If it be said that their
“separateness” consisted not in keeping apart from the
people, but that they were “separate” in the sense of their
being so much holier, the reply is that in this case we should
not expect their name to be derived from the root <em>p-r-sh</em>,
but from what would have been the far more appropriate
one <em>q-d-sh</em>, which means “separate” in the sense in which
holiness brings this about.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> But what is further a
strong argument against this theory is the fact that it has
absolutely no support from the sources. Josephus says,
for example, that “while the Sadducees are able to
persuade none but the rich, and have not the populace
as their followers, the Pharisees have the multitude on
their side.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> That certainly does not look like separation
from the ordinary people. Further, Leszynsky has collected
some interesting <em>data</em> from the Mishna showing that in
Pharisaic literature the term to “separate oneself” is
used in a disparaging sense; in Niddah iv. 2, for example,
this very term is used in reference to the Sadducees, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
are blamed as those who “separate themselves” from the
congregation. Again, Hillel gives the command: “Separate
not thyself from the congregation” (Aboth ii. 4). So
that everything points to the theory which would explain
the name Pharisee as “Separatist” as wrong. A more
probable explanation is that already hinted at by Josephus,
who says in <cite>Bell. Jud.</cite>, II, viii. 14 of the Pharisees that
“they are those who seem to explain the laws with accuracy.”
Here we may recall the passage, Nehemiah viii. 8,
referred to in the preceding chapter, where it is said that
the teachers of the Law “read in the book, in the Law of
God, interpreting [from the root <em>p-r-sh</em>] it; and they gave
the sense, and caused (the people) to understand the reading.”
Further, in Rabbinical literature this root, <em>p-r-sh</em>,
from which the name Pharisee is derived, is constantly found
used in the sense of to “explain,” “expound,” or “interpret,”
in reference to Scripture which is explained in the
interests of the oral Law. So that, while the root <em>p-r-sh</em>
means both to “separate” and to “interpret,” all the evidence
goes to show that as used in connection with the name
Pharisee it has the sense of to “interpret” or “expound.”
The term Pharisees may thus be said to mean “expounders”
of the Scriptures in the interests of the oral Law; and this
is just what the Pharisees were <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. Their
close association with the Scribes, as often alluded to in
the Gospels, serves still further to support this view.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_b">(<i>b</i>) <i>Sadducees.</i></h5>

<p>When transliterated from its Hebrew form the term “Sadducees”
appears as <em>Zaddūkim</em>; it has been held that this
is derived from the Hebrew word <em>zaddik</em>, “righteous.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
But this derivation is improbable, for no analogy exists
for this change of an <em>i</em> into <em>u</em>; but, even apart from this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
to explain <em>Zaddūkim</em> as meaning the “righteous ones”
has no support from fact; for the Sadducees were never
regarded as particularly righteous by others, nor did they
ever make such a claim themselves.</p>

<p>An interesting explanation, offered, however, “with
great diffidence,” is that given by Cowley. He says: “In
modern Persian the word <em>Zindīk</em> is used in the sense of
Manichæan, or, in a general sense, for infidel, one who does
not believe in the resurrection or in the omnipotence of
God. It has been adopted in Arabic with the meaning of
infidel, and also in Armenian. Masūdi (tenth century)
says that the name arose in the time of Manes to denote
his teaching, and explains that it is derived from the Zend,
or explanation, of the Avesta. The original Avesta was
the truly sacred book, and the person who followed only
the commentary was called a <em>Zindīk</em>, as one who rejected
the word of God to follow worldly tradition, irreligious.
But the term cannot have originated in the time of Manes
(third century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), for the Zend ‘commentary,’ whatever
view be taken as to its date, was by then already becoming
unintelligible. It must be much earlier, and have acquired
the general sense of infidel very soon.... Makrīzī (fifteenth
century), who borrows largely from Masūdi, confuses
the <em>Zanādikah</em> with the Samaritans and Sadducees, and
says that they deny the existence of angels, the resurrection,
and the prophets after Moses, whence it has been suggested
that <em>Zanādikah</em> is a corruption of <em>Zaddūkim</em>. The reverse,
may, however, be the case. It is quite possible that the
Persian word was used about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200 in the sense of
‘Zoroastrian,’ and if so, it might be applied by opponents
to a party in Judæa who sympathized with foreign ideas,
and rejected beliefs which were beginning to be regarded as
distinctively Jewish. It would thus have been used at
first in a contemptuous sense, and, later, when the original
meaning was forgotten, was, in the well-known Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
manner, transformed in such a way as to bear the interpretation
‘Sons of Zadok’ (<em>Bĕni Zadōk</em>) with a suggestion of
‘righteous’ (<em>Zaddīkim</em>).... It may be mentioned, though
perhaps as a mere coincidence, that <em>Zanādikah</em> is used for
Sadducees in Arabic translations of the New Testament.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
Interesting and most ingenious as this theory is, it does
not seem to be a sufficiently natural explanation; moreover,
in one important respect the <em>Zindīk</em> presented a marked
contrast in principle to the Sadducee; for while the <em>Zindīk</em>
was one who followed the Zend, or explanation of the
Avesta, the truly sacred book, i.e. “who rejected the word
of God to follow worldly tradition,” the Sadducee was
just the reverse, for he clung to the word of God, and he
rejected the authority of the oral tradition, i.e. the Pharisaic
explanations and traditions.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> And further, as we
shall see later, the normal type of Sadducee was not
necessarily worldly or irreligious.</p>

<p>A third view, and one which may be regarded as the
correct one, is that the term Sadducees (<em>Zaddūkim</em>) takes
its origin from the personal name Zadok. The sons of
Zadok (<em>Bĕni Zadōk</em>) were the descendants of the high-priest
Zadok, whose family had exercised the priestly functions
from the time of David (1 Chron. v. 27-41, xv. 11, xvi. 30,
40)<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> right up to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, when
their rule came to an end<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>; but the party continued to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
exist. Most modern scholars accept this explanation,
which has, indeed, now been placed beyond doubt by the
evidence of the <em>Zadokite Fragments</em> (see further <a href="#R-1">§ iii. (<i>e</i>)
of this chapter</a>).<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>So much, then, for the origin of the terms “Pharisees”
and “Sadducees.” We turn next to consider the sources
whence we derive our knowledge of these two parties and
their special tenets.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVII_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Sources</span></h4>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_a2">(<i>a</i>) <i>Josephus.</i></h5>

<p>That the evidence to be derived from the writings of
Josephus regarding the Pharisees and Sadducees is of great
value is undeniable; but two facts must be borne in mind
which show that this evidence has to be sifted before it
can be relied upon. The first is this: Josephus does not
write as a Jew with Jewish interests, but as a Greek from a
Greek standpoint. A striking illustration of this is that to
him the Jewish parties represent Greek schools of philosophy;
thus, he compares the Pharisees with the Stoics,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> the
Essenes with the Pythagoræans,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and, although he does
not directly say so, he evidently thought the Sadducæan
point of view on some things closely connected with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Epicuræanism.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> In some ways Josephus was well equipped
for giving information about Jewish parties, for he belonged
to an aristocratic priestly family, he was related on the
maternal side to the high-priest, was brought up as a Pharisee
learned in the Law, and later became intimately acquainted
with the teaching of the Sadducees and Essenes.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
But this advantage is to some extent neutralized by his
Hellenistic leaning as well as by the fact that war and
politics interested him more than questions concerning
Jewish religious culture. If his works are to be used with
effect it is necessary to bring into the Greek scenery which
he presents a Jewish colouring; one has constantly to be
asking oneself, as Leszynsky humorously puts it, whether
the shining armour of the warrior or the cloak of the
philosopher may not, after all, contain a Rabbi.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The second fact which somewhat detracts from the value
of Josephus’ evidence is that in all probability that evidence
is incomplete; for he says on two occasions in his <cite>Antiquities</cite>
(VIII, v. 9, XVIII, i. 2), when speaking of the Jewish
parties, that this subject is dealt with in the <cite>Jewish War</cite>,
book the second; but on turning to this (II, viii. 14) we find
a very scanty reference to the Pharisees and Sadducees,
more scanty than the passing notices in the <cite>Antiquities</cite>;
while the Essenes, the least important of the three bodies,
are treated at considerable length. At the close of
the chapter Josephus says: “This is what I had to say
about the philosophic sects among the Jews.” One is
forced to the conclusion that a considerable section has
for some unknown reason been lost,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and that therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the evidence of Josephus on the subject of the Jewish parties
is incomplete.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_b2">(<i>b</i>) <i>Rabbinical Sources.</i></h5>

<p>The earliest of these is the Mishna, which belongs to the
second half of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; somewhat later is
the <em>Tosephta</em>,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> i.e. a collection of “additions” to the Mishna;
these additions consist of matter not incorporated in the
Mishna, but they are taken from the same mass of floating
traditional material of which the Mishna is made up.
The three Midrashic works, <em>Sifra</em> (a commentary on
Leviticus), <em>Sifre</em> (a commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy),
and <em>Mechilta</em> (a commentary on Exodus), are also
valuable sources.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Comparatively late as all these sources
are—the earliest belongs to a time after the Sadducees
and Pharisees had ceased to exist as parties—they are
nevertheless of high importance because they all utilize
traditional material belonging to earlier times, much of
which most likely existed in written form; so that they
contain many traditions dating back to the second
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The evidence contained in these sources consists in the
main of records of controversies on various topics between
Pharisees and Sadducees. It is in the highest degree
improbable that these accounts should be fictitious, for
by the time that they were incorporated in the Mishna the
Pharisees had long triumphed over the Sadducees; there
would, therefore, have been no point in making them up;
they are evidently genuine records.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_c2">(<i>c</i>) <i>The New Testament.</i></h5>

<p>This source is so familiar that it will be unnecessary to
do more than merely mention it.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_d2">(<i>d</i>) <i>The Zadokite Fragments.</i></h5>

<p>These are two fragments, discovered a few years ago by
Schechter in the Cairo <em>Genizah</em>.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> They belong respectively
to the eleventh and twelfth centuries <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and deal with
the religious beliefs and practices, as well as with details of
the constitution, of a Jewish sect which existed in Damascus
during the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> before the Maccabæan
struggle. This sect possessed, in addition to the Old
Testament, other sacred books; it had its special laws
interpreting various commandments in Scripture; and it
had, moreover, its own calendar. The sect looked upon itself
as the remnant to which God had revealed “the hidden
things in which all Israel erred.” The members of this
sect had a special dislike for the Pharisees, against whom
their polemics were directed. In the text of one of the
manuscripts the Pharisees are denounced as transgressors
of the Covenant; and various other accusations are brought
against them, such as polygamy, and a wrong way of
observing the dietary laws and the Levitical laws of purity.
The Law, it is contended, was only discovered with the
rise of Zadok. This antagonism to the Pharisees stamps
the sect as representing some form of Sadducæanism, and
this is further emphasized by the fact that the Messianic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
doctrine taught agrees with that of the Sadducees against
the Pharisaic teaching on the subject. The fragments
raise a number of other questions which cannot be discussed
here; the point of chief importance for us lies in the
Sadducæan character of their contents.</p>

<p>These, then, are the sources from which we gain our information
regarding the specific doctrines of the Sadducees
and Pharisees, which we now proceed to consider.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Doctrines of the Pharisees and Sadducees</span></h4>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_a3">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Law.</i></h5>

<p>As the attitude of the Pharisees to the Law is so well
known not many words need be devoted to describing it.
All the sources agree that they were the champions <i lang="fr">par
excellence</i> not so much of the written Law, but specifically
of the oral Law, and that their energies were concentrated
on the elaboration and minute observance of the latter.
It is the attitude of the Sadducees to the Law with which
we shall, therefore, mainly concern ourselves, for some other
points of Sadducæan doctrine are closely connected with
this.</p>

<p>We may begin by quoting the evidence of Josephus;
he says in <cite>Antiquities</cite> XIII, x. 6: “The Pharisees have
delivered to the people from the tradition of the fathers
all manner of ordinances not contained in the laws of
Moses; for which reason the sect of the Sadducees reject
these ordinances; for they affirm that only such laws
ought to be observed as are written, while those which are
orally delivered from the tradition of the fathers are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
binding. And concerning these things great questionings
and differences have arisen among them.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>This piece of evidence may be frankly accepted, as far as
it goes, not only because in itself it contains nothing intrinsically
improbable, but also because it is borne out by
the other sources. It shows us what was the fundamental
cause of difference between the Pharisees and Sadducees,
viz., as to whether anything besides the written Law was
binding. What is particularly noticeable here is the fact
that the Sadducees, not the Pharisees, were the real champions
of the Law as such<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>; the Sadducees were the guardians
of the Law in its purity, and desired to keep it free from
accretions; the Pharisees were bent on attaching to the
Law ordinances of which the Law itself knew nothing,
and of making both equally authoritative and binding.
But from this a very important thing results: as champions
of the Law how can it be said, as is so often said, that the
Sadducees, as a party, were worldly and lax as regards
religious interests? In one passage, it is true, Josephus
speaks of the opponents of the Pharisees as those who
offend against the holy laws (<cite>Bell. Jud.</cite>, I, v. 1), but the
context shows that by these were meant the laws of the
Pharisees, as distinct from the Law which was venerated
by the Sadducees quite as much as by the Pharisees.</p>

<p>The <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite> corroborate what has been said
in so far that in them the Pentateuch, cited under the
term Torah, is considered the main authority.</p>

<p>In the Gospels we have no direct evidence concerning the
Sadducæan standpoint regarding the Law; but there are
many indications regarding that of the Pharisees and their
insistence on the oral traditions. These are, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
sufficiently well known not to require detailed mention
here. One matter of special interest may be noted in
passing, namely, that, so far as questions of the Law are
concerned, Christ upholds the Sadducæan standpoint.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The Rabbinical sources on this subject are of the highest
importance; a detailed examination of them would require
a special volume, but much valuable information has been
gathered by Hölscher<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and, in greater abundance, by
Leszynsky.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Though the evidence is of a complicated character
it fully bears out that of Josephus on this point.
The Sadducees stood for the written Law, and this only;
the Pharisees insisted upon the binding authority of the
tradition of the fathers as well. That is the fundamental
difference between them; the developments which either
party saw itself compelled to countenance arose logically
and irresistibly from this fundamental principle regarding
the Law. But these developments were profoundly important.
We will put the matter as succinctly as possible.
The Sadducees stood for the written Law; but in the
nature of things it constantly happened that new cases
came up for decision for which the written Law provided
no solution or guidance. The Sadducees were thus forced
to put forth new ordinances; and in this they followed,
<i lang="la">nolens volens</i>, the example of the Pharisees<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; but, true to
their fundamental principle, they saw to it that these new
ordinances were based upon the written Law, so that they
could claim that if changed conditions of life, or whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
other cause, necessitated the putting forth of new legal
ordinances, these were at any rate developments of the
written Law.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> With the Pharisees it was different; they
had always, in addition to the Law, championed the traditions
of the fathers, i.e. the popular customs handed down
from time immemorial; these had constantly been added
to, whether based upon the written Law or not. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the point of view of loyalty to the Law the Sadducæan
position was unassailable, while that of the Pharisees was
open to objection. The result was an intensive study of
the letter of the Law (i.e. the Pentateuch), both by Pharisees
and Sadducees; the former undertook this in order, by a
method of interpretation peculiarly Pharisaic, to prove
that the oral tradition was based on the written Law.
They were forced to this by the more strictly legal attitude
of the Sadducees; these latter, too, gave themselves to
the minute study of the Pentateuch as never before, because,
as the true guardians of the Law, they had to see whether
in each individual case the Pharisaic contention was justified
that such and such an ordinance of the oral tradition was
based upon the written Law.</p>

<p>Thus endless discussions and acrimonious disputes arose
between the two parties, which became further embittered
by doctrinal disagreements. The Pharisees won the day
ultimately, for they were able to show by subtle exegesis
that the oral tradition was based upon the written Law.
But, and this is the great point, the Sadducæan principle
was thus victorious; as a party they went under; but
the Pharisees, by adopting the Sadducæan principle that
nothing is binding that cannot be shown to be in accordance
with the written Law, implicitly acknowledged that the
Sadducees had been right all along.</p>

<p>Leszynsky, in his masterly thesis on the subject, concludes
the section on the evidence of Rabbinical sources with these
words, which admirably sum up the matter: “The Pharisees
conquered. True! And when with Rabbi Akiba
the Pharisaic art of interpretation reached its zenith, and
every letter of the Torah had been fitted into the Pharisaic
system—then Sadducæanism came to an end. But they
had only conquered by appropriating the principle of the
enemy. From the party of tradition arose the party of
the Torah as traditionally conceived. Rabbinical Judaism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
is in truth a synthesis of Pharisaism and Sadducæanism.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
See further below, § iv.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_b3">(<i>b</i>) <i>The Doctrine of God.</i></h5>

<p>On this subject Josephus (<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XIII, v. 9) tells us
that while the Pharisees hold that some things in the world
happen by the will of Providence, and that in other cases
things lie in the power of men, the Sadducees, on the other
hand, altogether deny the existence of Providence as an
active force in the world; if, indeed, there is such a thing
at all, they say, it does not concern itself with the affairs
of men. Everything lies in the hand of men themselves,
they alone are the cause if prosperity be their lot, while
adversity is simply the result of their own foolishness.
Again, in another passage (<cite>Bell. Jud.</cite>, II, viii. 14) he tells
us that, in contradistinction to the Pharisees, the Sadducees
do not believe in Providence; they deny that God takes
any interest in human affairs; good or evil is the lot of
men according to their own free choice. This evidence
of Josephus cannot be accepted so far as the Sadducees
are concerned; we have seen that the written Law, or
Pentateuch, was the supreme authority according to Sadducæan
teaching; but in the Pentateuch the doctrine of
God is such as to make it impossible to believe that what
Josephus says really reflects Sadducæan belief here. What
is said over and over again in the Pentateuch regarding
the divine guidance of men and God’s incessant interposition
in the affairs of the world of His creation impels
one to affirm that Josephus is wrong in his contention
that the Sadducees denied the existence of Providence.
It is probable that the partisanship of the Pharisee Josephus
has somewhat carried him away, and that he has, perhaps
unconsciously, here misrepresented the Sadducæan position.
This is the more probable in that, as we shall see presently,
positive proof of such misrepresentation in another direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
is forthcoming. When we turn to our other sources
we find, in the first place, that in the Zadokite fragments
the doctrine of God is in accordance with Old Testament
teaching, and therefore in opposition to what Josephus
says. In the second place, the evidence of the New Testament
distinctly implies that the Sadducees did believe
in the direct action of Providence in the affairs of men.
Thus, we are told that when John the Baptist saw that
many Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to his baptism,
he said to them: “Ye offspring of vipers, who warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> If fear from the
wrath to come was what induced the Sadducees, as well as
the Pharisees, to come and be baptized, the fact proves
that they believed in the divine interposition in the affairs
of the world. Again, the same is implied in the words:
“And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting
Him asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
And, once more, in the account of the discussion in the
Sanhedrin as to what was to be done to St. Peter and the
other apostles, who had been put in the public ward by
the Sadducees,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Gamaliel concludes the discussion with a
speech which ends with these words: “And now I say
unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone;
for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown;
but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow
them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against
God”; it is then said: “And to him they agreed.” If
there had been any real difference between the Pharisaic
and Sadducæan doctrine of God this agreement would not
have been recorded. We have an interesting example of
what took place in the event of doctrinal disagreement in
Acts xxiii. 1-10. We are, therefore, justified in concluding
that on this subject the two parties agreed. So that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
evidence of the New Testament is also against Josephus.
The silence of the Rabbinical sources on this subject is
of itself sufficient to prove Josephus wrong, for had there
been any difference of belief on such a supremely important
subject it is quite inconceivable that the Rabbis would
have kept silence.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_c3">(<i>c</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Future Life.</i></h5>

<p>In <cite>Bell. Jud.</cite>, II, viii. 14, Josephus says that the Pharisees
taught the incorruptibility of the soul, but that the Sadducees
“did not believe in the immortal duration of the
soul, and the rewards and punishments in Hades,” their
belief being that “the souls die with the bodies.” In
one respect here, as Leszynsky has pointed out, we are
able to prove that Josephus has coloured his account;
for Pharisaic Judaism taught not merely the incorruptibility
of the soul, but also a doctrine of the resurrection
of the body; but because this latter thought was strange
to the Greeks he did not make mention of it. In his later
work Josephus corrects himself in so far as to say that the
Pharisees believed not only in the incorruptibility of the
soul, but also in its continued life hereafter; his words
are: “They (the Pharisees) also believe that souls have an
immortal vigour in them, and that under the earth there
will be rewards or punishments, according as they have
lived virtuously or viciously in this life; and that the latter
are to be detained in an everlasting prison, but that the
former shall have power to revive and live again.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> According
to these words there was no difference in this
respect between the Pharisees and the Essenes; but even
here Josephus cannot bring himself to declare the whole
truth concerning the real Pharisaic doctrine of the resurrection.
“It is probable,” says Leszynsky, “that this
error immediately resulted in the rise of another, for since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
the Essenes had their belief in immortality, and the Pharisees
that of the incorruptibility of the soul—or, as in the
other account, the continued life of the soul hereafter—there
remained nothing for the Sadducees but a denial pure
and simple of the future life. He who, like Josephus, puts
resurrection and immortality on precisely the same plane,
necessarily imputes to him who denies the resurrection
the view that the soul is perishable.... But both from
the Talmud (Sanhedrin 90<i>b</i>) and from the New Testament
(Matt. xxii. 23 ff.; Acts xxiii. 8, cp. iv. 1), we know that
the Sadducees denied only the doctrine of the resurrection,
for they required proof of this from the Torah which was
not forthcoming. But of this un-Greek dogma Josephus
would have nothing to say.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The possibility that the
Sadducees held the ancient Israelite conception of the
existence of the soul in Sheol must, at any rate, be allowed;
for we cannot accept the evidence of Josephus here unreservedly.
If we had only the New Testament and the
Talmud to go upon we should certainly not deny that
the Sadducees believed in accordance with the ancient
dogma of their race; yet these two sources are assuredly
more reliable than Josephus. There is, moreover, nothing
in the Zadokite fragments to support the evidence of Josephus.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
We may, therefore, conclude that the Sadducees
believed in the immortality of the soul, but not in any
doctrine of the resurrection.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_d3">(<i>d</i>) <i>The Sadducæan attitude regarding Belief in the existence
of Angels and Spirits.</i></h5>

<p>In Acts xxiii. 8 it is said that “the Sadducees say that
there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit”; this
is the only authority which we have on the latter point;
it is not referred to either in Josephus’ works or in the
Talmud, nor have the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite> anything to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
say about it. Now since the Sadducees regarded the written
Law as their final authority, it would certainly have been
strange if they had really denied the existence of angels,
for one has but to recall such passages as Genesis xvi. 1 ff.,
xxviii. 10 ff., Numbers xx. 16, xxii. 22 ff., and others, to
realize that the written Law distinctly teaches a doctrine
of angels. One has, therefore, to recognize the possibility
that what is said on this subject in Acts xxiii. 8 may be
due to a mistaken inference derived from the Sadducæan
disbelief in the resurrection, namely, that the <em>departed</em>
do not become angels or spirits<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>; this does not necessarily
deny the existence of angelic beings who have never been
in the flesh.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_e3">(<i>e</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Messiah.</i></h5>

<p>One other specifically Sadducæan doctrine must be
briefly mentioned, namely that of the Messiah. As against
the Pharisees, who taught that the Messiah was to be of
the seed of David, and who thus held the old prophetic
belief of Isaiah and Jeremiah, the Sadducees, regarding the
Pentateuchal Law as the supreme arbiter in all matters,
and finding nothing there which spoke of the Messianic
ruler as belonging to the house of David, held that Aaron
and his seed were the chosen ones from whom the Messiah
would ultimately proceed; it was with Phinehas, the
grandson of Aaron, that God had made an eternal covenant;
and, therefore, as Ezekiel (xliv. 15 ff.) had prophesied,
the sons of Zadok<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> were to be the rulers of the people,
and the Messiah must be of priestly blood (cp. Exod. xix.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
6).<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> So that, as Leszynsky points out (p. 94), the very name
of the Sadducæan party, i.e. the Zadokites (the descendants
of Zadok) also had a place in the strife regarding the Torah
<i lang="la">versus</i> Tradition.</p>

<p id="R-1">In the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite> the teaching concerning the
Messiah is important; there is frequent reference to a
“Teacher” who is called the “Only Teacher,” or the
“Only One,” and is identical with “the Lawgiver who
interprets the Law.” There is a period intervening before
the first appearance of this Teacher, who was the Founder
of the Sect, and his second appearance, which is to be at
“the end of the days.” Now this Teacher is identified
with the Messiah, “the Anointed One from Aaron and
Israel, whose advent is expected by the Sect, through
whom He made them to know His holy spirit, and in whose
rise the Sect saw the fulfilment of the prophecy, <em>there shall
come a star out of Jacob</em>. Apparently this Anointed One
was rejected by the great bulk of the nation who ‘spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
rebellion’ against Him. What must be especially noted is
that the Messiah of the Sect is a priest, a descendant from
Aaron and Israel. Of a Messiah descending from Judah
there is no mention in our text. Indeed, ‘after the completing
of the end ... one shall not join the house of Judah,’
whilst the princes of Judah, the removers of the bound,
will be visited by the wrath of God. Among these princes,
King David is also included, who is held in slight estimation
by the Sect. As a contrast to and substitute for David
and his dynasty, the Sect put up Zadok, and his descendants,
the sons of Zadok.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> There is nothing which so stamps
the character of these fragments as just this doctrine of
the Messiah.</p>


<h5 id="PI_CHVII_f3">(<i>f</i>) <i>The Sadducees and the Jewish Calendar.</i></h5>

<p>This is a somewhat intricate subject; but the main
point is that the Sadducees held that time must be measured
on the basis of a solar year; they thus opposed the Pharisaic
mode of reckoning which was on the basis of the lunar year.
The Pharisees followed the ancient Hebrew tradition;
but the unsatisfactory character of this mode of reckoning
time must have been realized in early times; and the
Pharisees, in getting over the obvious difficulties by inserting
a thirteenth month in the spring whenever necessary,
were following the oral Tradition. This was sufficient
for the opposition of the Sadducees who sought to reform
the Calendar by measuring time on the basis of the solar
year. The Sadducees and Pharisees accordingly accused each
other of observing feasts at a wrong time,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> or of wishing to.</p>

<p>Of the ordinary sources only the Rabbinical contain
echoes, and these but slight, of the controversy which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
existed between the Sadducees and Pharisees on this
subject<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>; but the Book of Jubilees, the Book of 1 Enoch and
the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs give indications
of it; and in the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite> there are also references
to the subject; Schechter says in his introduction:
“Another point of supreme importance separating them
[i.e. the members of the Zadokite sect] both from Jew as
well as Samaritan is the regulation of the calendar. The
Sect looks upon itself as the remnant unto which God
revealed ‘the hidden things in which all Israel erred:
His Holy Sabbaths and His glorious festivals, the testimony
of His righteousness and the ways of His truth and the
desires of His will which a man shall do and live by them.’
It need hardly be pointed out that this passage is a mere
paraphrase of the passage in the Book of Jubilees: ‘And
all the children of Israel will forget, and will not find the
path of the years, and will forget the new moons, and
seasons, and Sabbaths, and they will go wrong as to all
the order of the years’ (vi. 34 ff.). The ‘hidden things’
are, in the Book of Jubilees, disclosed to the Sect by a
special revelation (vi. 3), but the calendar of <ins class="corr" id="tn-151" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'this pseudepipraphic'">
this pseudepigraphic</ins> work differs in the most important essentials
both from that of the Pharisees and from that of the Samaritans”
(p. xvi.). In the Book of Jubilees the solar year is
accepted.</p>

<p>That this controversy must have been of an acute character
is obvious, and at first one may wonder that the
ordinary sources do not refer to it. But in the New Testament
one would not expect any reference to it; and Josephus
is mainly concerned with doctrinal points when
speaking about the Sadducees. As to the slight mention
of the subject in Rabbinical Literature Leszynsky explains it
by saying that “it would almost seem as though the Rabbis
wished by their silence to kill this the most dangerous of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
all questions which menaced Judaism; they did not wish to
raise up again the spirit of doubt to quell which had cost
them so much trouble.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, we have definite witness to the existence
of the quarrel in some of the pseudepigraphic books,
as hinted above, and the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite>, as we have
just seen, offer strong evidence in regard to it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is, of course, a great deal more that might be said
on the whole subject of the Pharisees and Sadducees,
especially about the Pharisees; but our main purpose
has been to set forth the chief differences of doctrine between
the two; and we have laid more stress on the Sadducæan
position because this has not, as a rule, received the same
attention as the Pharisaic.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">Some Subsidiary Considerations</span></h4>

<p>It is of importance to recognize that, with one exception,
viz. the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite>, the main sources which give
us information about the Sadducees come from the hands
of adversaries. Josephus was a Pharisee, or at all events
he claimed to be; the New Testament writers, for obvious
reasons, had little sympathy with the Sadducees; the
Rabbis were the spiritual descendants of the bitterest
enemies of the Sadducees. But even so, some of the adverse
impressions about the Sadducees widely current do not
receive much support from the sources. For example,
it is often assumed that the Sadducees were lax in regard
to the Law, that they were sceptics and irreligious generally;
but this is not borne out by the evidence when used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
with discrimination. Josephus nowhere says that the
Sadducees were irreligious or antagonistic to the Law;
nor does the New Testament represent them to have been
so. Neither do the acrimonious discussions between the
Sadducees and Pharisees on legal questions preserved in
Rabbinical writings give the impression that the former
were indifferent to the Law. No doubt the Pharisees
looked upon the Sadducees as irreligious, but not because
of their attitude to the Law; to the Pharisees anyone who
repudiated the binding character of their conception of the
Law would come under condemnation; but we have no
right to brand as irreligious those who in their loyalty to
the written Law denounced Pharisaic accretions to the
same as of subordinate authority. That there were some
Sadducees who were worldly and irreligious is likely enough
to have been the case; but to characterize the Sadducees
as such, as the worldly, irreligious party, is to fall into the
same kind of error as those who say that the Pharisees
were all hypocrites.</p>

<p>Again, it is of course true that the Sadducees were always
on the side of the suzerain power; the high-priestly party
in the time of the Seleucidæ, as well as during the Roman
dominion, held to the ruling power; but to say that for this
reason the Sadducees were wholly occupied with politics, and
that they were merely a political party, is an exaggeration.
Their position necessitated a certain amount of intercourse
with the ruling power; but this did not involve the exclusion
of every other occupation, nor must we suppose
that all Sadducees were concerned even with a <em>minimum</em>
of political business. A Sadducee was not <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> a
politician, but those who were at the head of affairs, and
who were, therefore, necessarily politicians, happened to
belong to the Sadducæan party. It was precisely the same
thing with the Pharisees at one time, viz., at the beginning
of the reign of John Hyrcanus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 135-104), when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
were in close touch with the ruling power (in the person
of the high-priest), and were necessarily to some extent
occupied with politics<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>; yet nobody would say that at
that time the Pharisees as a body were wholly given up
to politics.</p>

<p>The Sadducees, to touch upon another point, were, like
the sons of Zadok of pre-Maccabæan times, the friends
of Hellenistic culture; the Sadducæan party was the
party of enlightenment. At first sight this strikes one as
incongruous, since the Sadducees were, as against the Pharisees,
conservatives in religious belief and practice. They
refused, for example, as we have seen, to accept the doctrine
of the resurrection of the body, which the Pharisees, being
as they claimed the party of religious progress, both welcomed
and taught. But the converse is true, too; it is
strange that the Pharisees who were the national party,
bigoted and narrow in their outlook, should have been
ready to accept teaching which was of non-Jewish origin.
The same incongruousness is to be seen in the respective
attitude of Sadducees and Pharisees towards the Law.
As Lauterbach truly says, the former “were conservative
and narrow in their views and strongly opposed to changes
and innovations. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were
the younger party, broader and more liberal in their views,
of progressive tendencies and not averse to innovations.
Accordingly, we should expect that the Sadducees, whose
priestly ancestors and predecessors had always been the
official teachers of the people, the custodians of the Law,
and presumably also of such tradition as there was, and
who themselves were very conservative, the natural advocates
of traditional ways and views, would seek to uphold
the authority of tradition and the binding character of
its Laws. On the other hand, we should expect the Pharisees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
being the younger, more progressive and liberal party,
which applied new methods of interpretation and developed
new theories, to deny the authority of tradition and reject
its laws. But, instead, we are led to believe that in their
attitude towards the authority of the traditional laws the
two parties had changed <i lang="fr">rôles</i>. For the conservative
Sadducees are said to have opposed the authority of tradition
and the binding character of its teachings, while the
Pharisees, who in many points departed from traditional
ways and favoured new views, are represented as the advocates
of tradition and of the authority of its laws.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
Lauterbach’s explanation of the difficulty that the disputes
between the Pharisees and Sadducees were not so much
about the contents of tradition, but merely about its
authority, no doubt holds good in part, but only in part, for
the records of the disputes which have come down to us are
much concerned with the <em>contents</em> of tradition.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> We doubt
whether the full explanation of the incongruity is in its
essence really other than this: the innate illogic of human
nature. Is any party ever logical and true to its tenets
for long; above all, a religious party? Would any party
be really honest if it were? New conditions alter the
outlook; new truths tend to displace old landmarks;
and the consequent new ways of thinking will impel honest
men sometimes to modify their most cherished beliefs. The
conditions brought about through the Maccabæan struggle,
and the gradual triumph of some specifically Hellenistic
<em>traits</em>, above all of religious syncretism, will account almost
wholly for what appears to be the <i lang="la">volte face</i> of both Sadducees
and Pharisees. While one can well understand that the
Sadducees, as represented by their spiritual forbears in pre-Maccabæan
times, belonging as they did to the priestly
aristocracy, and generally to the more cultured classes, should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
be friendly inclined towards the mental refinement and
enlightenment such as Hellenism offered, there can be no
doubt that before the outbreak of the Maccabæan struggle,
their over-anxiety in this direction involved them in deplorable
disloyalty both to their nation, and to their
religious principles. We may grant that many belonging to
this school of thought honestly believed that the more fully
the people came under the sway of Hellenistic influence
the more beneficial it would be for all concerned, yet there
is no getting away from the fact that their behaviour as
recorded in 1 Maccabees was unpatriotic, and by acquiescing
in the abrogation of the Law, or rather in the attempt to
abrogate it, they acted clean contrary to their fundamental
principles. Indeed, it is so difficult to understand their
action that we are perhaps justified in believing that the
support accorded to Antiochus Epiphanes in his attempt
to stamp out Judaism came only from an extreme section
of the Hellenistically inclined party. For when all is
said and done, they were Jews, and, as a body, venerated
the Law, as such, like other Jews, and worshipped the same
God as other Jews; so that with all their partiality for
Greek culture they held firmly, as the sources prove, to
what was specifically Jewish in spite of internal quarrels,
bitter as these proverbially are.</p>

<p>From all that we have learned about the Sadducees and
the school of thought which they represent, it must be
clear that at one time they constituted a powerful and
influential element among the Jews, with definite principles
and doctrines which they championed. The question,
therefore, suggests itself as to whether any literary remains
emanating from their circles have come down to us. It is
generally acknowledged that Ecclesiasticus is “Sadducæan”
in character, so that the Sadducees and their pre-Maccabæan
representatives were evidently not without their
scholars and writers; we should, therefore, naturally look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
for other examples of Sadducæan literary activity. We
have become accustomed to be told that any book in which
the Law is extolled is necessarily Pharisaic; but in view
of what we have seen to be the Sadducæan attitude towards
the Law, something more than the upholding of the Law is
required in a book in order to establish its Pharisaic authorship;
unless it is clear that the <em>Pharisaic conception</em> of
the Law is in the mind of the writer, the book could just as
well be Sadducæan, so far as this particular point is concerned.
But the doctrine concerning the Law is, of course,
not the only criterion whereby the character, whether
Sadducæan or Pharisaic, of a book is to be judged; when
we come to consider the authorship of the uncanonical
books, the Pseudepigrapha as well as the Apocrypha,
we shall have to take into consideration all the doctrines
to which reference has been made above; and it may be
that in some cases we shall find that there are reasons for
considering a book to be Sadducæan which is usually supposed
to be Pharisaic. If this is so, then our sources for the
Sadducees may be increased. But since this is a very
disputed matter, we have thought it best not to include
among the sources given above books which we shall show
reasons for regarding as Sadducæan.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVII_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>The term “Pharisee” means not “Separatist,” but
“Expounder” of the Scriptures in the interests of the oral
Law. The term “Sadducees” is derived from the personal
name Zadok, who was high-priest in the time of
David.</p>

<p>The sources of our knowledge of the Pharisees and Sadducees
are: Josephus, Rabbinical writings, the New
Testament, and the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite>. The doctrines
regarding which the Pharisees and Sadducees differed were:
the Law, which the Sadducees regarded as binding only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
in so far as the written Law was concerned, while the Pharisees
claimed the same for the oral Law. The Sadducees came
to recognize the need of making new legal ordinances,
but only such as were based upon the written Law. The
oral tradition of the Pharisees had arisen independently
of the written Law; but the Pharisees were ultimately
forced to accept the Sadducæan principle, and by subtle
exegesis showed that the oral tradition was actually based
upon the written Law. Thus, though the Sadducees ceased
to exist as a party, their principle won the day.</p>

<p>Secondly, as regards the doctrine of Providence, there
is every reason to distrust the evidence of Josephus, who
contends that the Sadducees denied the existence of Providence;
this is not borne out by the other sources, and
is in itself highly improbable.</p>

<p>The real difference between the Pharisees and Sadducees
on the subject of the life hereafter was that while the former
believed in the resurrection of the body, the latter denied
this, and believed only in the immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>Regarding the alleged Sadducæan disbelief in angels
and spirits, which is stated in only one of the sources, the
New Testament, one must recognize the possibility that
what is said on this subject in Acts xxiii. 8 may be due to
a mistaken inference derived from the Sadducæan disbelief
in the resurrection of the body, namely, that the <em>departed</em>
do not become angels or spirits. In view of the Sadducæan
belief in the Pentateuch, where angels are often spoken of,
it is improbable that they denied the existence of these.</p>

<p>A fundamental difference of belief between Pharisees
and Sadducees was that regarding the Messiah; while
the Pharisees held that the Messiah was to be of the seed
of David, the Sadducees maintained that Aaron and his
seed, to which the sons of Zadok belonged, were the chosen
ones from whom the Messiah would ultimately proceed.
Lastly, differences of opinion existed among the two parties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
regarding the Calendar; these centred in the fact that
while the Sadducees measured time on the basis of the solar
year, the Pharisaic method of reckoning was on the basis
of the lunar year. The result of this was that each party
accused the other of false teaching regarding the time at
which the feasts ought to be kept.</p>

<p>Among some subsidiary considerations concerning the
Sadducees it was pointed out that to speak of them as
sceptics and irreligious, as a body, is to do them an injustice;
equally unjust is it to regard them as having been
mainly occupied with politics. On the other hand, the
exaggerated pro-Hellenic tendencies of those who came
to be known as the Sadducæan party after the Maccabæan
struggle, involved them in disloyalty to their race and
to their religious principles. It is probable that those who
were guilty of this constituted only an extreme section of
those favourable to Hellenistic influence.</p>

<p>The way in which the Sadducees and Pharisees to some
extent changed <i lang="fr">rôles</i>, so far as their attitude to the Law
was concerned, can be explained on natural lines.</p>

<p>The literary remains of the Sadducees are perhaps more
than we have been accustomed to suppose; further reference
is made to this subject in <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">We have, in the preceding chapters, considered the
mental and spiritual movements in Palestine, and
have sought to show in how large a measure these were
affected by Hellenistic influence, and how, on the other
hand, resistance to this influence called into existence a
counter-movement which ultimately carried all before it.
The Hellenistic Movement with its profound influence upon
the Jews of Palestine, and its still profounder and more far-reaching
influence upon the Jews of the Dispersion; the
Apocalyptic Movement, largely indigenous, but also greatly
influenced by the Hellenistic spirit; the Legalistic Movement,
initiated by Ezra and furthered by Scribal activity;
the opposing tendencies which resulted, viz., Particularism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
on the one hand, and Universalism on the other, tendencies
which remained such, and did not crystallize into parties
until after the Maccabæan struggle, so that both Scribes and
Apocalyptists could follow their individual bent, whether in
the direction of legal observance or of the pursuit of wisdom
or of eschatological study, without coming into conflict
with each other; the Maccabæan struggle which was the
culmination of the deeply-rooted tendencies just referred
to, and which resulted in the formation of two bitterly
opposed parties, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, each with
their fundamental principles essentially irreconcilable, each
living and vigorous, each illogical, each offering the curious
paradox of triumphing in defeat—these and various other
matters have all been dealt with in the preceding chapter,
with the object of presenting a picture of the intellectual
and religious surroundings from which, and owing to which,
the large body of literature emanated with which we shall
now have to concern ourselves. A not inconsiderable portion
of this literature was ultimately incorporated into what
came to be known as the Old Testament Canon; a large
portion which was studied and favourably looked upon
even by rigorously orthodox religious leaders among the
Jews was excluded from the Hebrew Canon, though admitted
into the Greek Bible of the Jews of the Dispersion; a further
and still larger portion of this literature was excluded, not
only from the Hebrew Canon of the Palestinian Jews, but
also from the Greek Bible of the Dispersion Jews.</p>

<p>Now to understand, first of all, how it came about that a
distinct line of demarcation was drawn between what we
now know as the canonical books, and those of the Apocrypha,
it will be necessary to consider briefly the <em>idea of a Canon</em>
in the Jewish Church, the approximate date at which this
idea arose, and the date at which the Canon was finally
closed. It will be important to touch also upon the question
as to whom the formation of the Canon was specially due,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
as well as the reason for which some books were admitted
into the Canon,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and others excluded. This will be our task
in the present chapter. The further questions concerning
the two other bodies of literature referred to just now will
occupy us in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>We must first offer a few remarks upon the subject of the
Hebrew Canon as we now have it in the Hebrew Bible.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVIII_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Hebrew Canon in its Present Form</span></h4>

<p>The Hebrew Bible contains twenty-four books<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>; the
following table will show the divisions and sub-divisions into
which these books were placed by the Jewish Church:<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>


<p class="negin2">i. The Law, or <em>Torah</em>, i.e. the five books of Moses, called
by the Jews the “five-fifths of the Law.”</p>

<p class="negin2">ii. The Prophets, or <em>Nebiim</em>; this has two sub-divisions:</p>

<p class="pad3 negin2">(<i>a</i>) The “Former Prophets,” or <em>Nebiim rishônim</em>, i.e.
the books of Joshua, Judges, 1, 2 Samuel, 1, 2
Kings.</p>

<p class="pad3 negin2">(<i>b</i>) The “Latter Prophets,” or <em>Nebiim acharônim</em>;
i.e. the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the
Twelve Minor Prophets, which are reckoned as
one book.</p>

<p class="negin2">iii. The Writings, or <em>Kethubim</em>; this has three sub-divisions:</p>

<p class="pad3 negin2">(<i>a</i>) Psalms, Proverbs, Job.</p>

<p class="pad3 negin2">(<i>b</i>) Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
Esther; these are technically known as the five
“Scrolls,” or <em>Megillôth</em>.</p>

<p class="pad3 negin2">(<i>c</i>) Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, 1, 2 Chronicles.</p>

<p>Regarding the first of these divisions, it may be pointed
out that the Jews regard the Law, or Torah, as by far the
most important part of their Scriptures, in comparison with
which the other two divisions occupy quite a subordinate
position; indeed, the “Prophets” and the “Writings” are
sometimes spoken of as mere “Tradition” (<em>Kabbalah</em>), in
contrast with the Law. As to the second division, it should
be noted that the Jews in early days regarded the two books
of Samuel<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> as one book, and the same applies to the two
books of Kings. The terms “Former” and “Latter”
Prophets do not refer to their respective dates of composition,
but must be taken to indicate the order of the books in
the canonical collection.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> In the third division we see, in
the first place, that the order of the books in each of the sub-divisions
differs from that of the English Bible; secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the books of Ezra and Nehemiah are treated as one book,
and this is also the case with 1, 2 Chronicles. The five
“Scrolls” occupy an important and somewhat special
position among the Jews, for they are assigned, for reading,
to particular feast-days and one fast-day, viz. Passover
(<em>Pesach</em>), Weeks (<em>Shebuôth</em>), the fast of the “ninth of Ab,”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
Tabernacles (<em>Succôth</em>), and Lots (<em>Purim</em>), respectively.</p>

<p>Thus, the first division has five books, the second has eight,
and the third has eleven, making twenty-four in all.</p>

<p>These books, then, constitute the Hebrew Canon in its
final form, the authoritative Scriptures to which no book
may be added, and from which no book may be taken away.
We have now to inquire as to when, by whom, and why these
books were singled out from among the mass of Jewish
literature to occupy this honoured position.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVIII_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Idea of a Canon</span></h4>

<p>In seeking to answer the question as to when the Hebrew
Canon assumed its present, final, form, it is well to begin by
emphasizing the need of distinguishing between a <em>collection
of books</em>, all valued more or less, and the <em>formation of a Canon</em>.
It is not only comprehensible, but altogether natural to find
that, given the existence of a large literature, a certain
number of books belonging to it should be more highly
valued and honoured than others contained in that literature;
it does not, however, therefore necessarily follow that
such more highly honoured books alone are acceptable and
widely used, or that they are regarded as so holy that not a
letter of them may be altered, while all other books belonging
to that literature are regarded as of inferior value and of no
authority.</p>

<p>Applying this to the sacred literature of the Jews as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
existed and grew, roughly speaking, during the last two pre-Christian
centuries, we must begin by leaving out the
Pentateuch from our present consideration; we are justified
in doing this, because these books, as containing the written
Law, occupied a position so unique from the Jewish point of
view that (from the time that they became books) they never
came under the category of ordinary books (see, however, below,
p. 168). Setting the Pentateuch aside, therefore, we affirm
that during the period indicated a large sacred literature
was in existence, and that a certain number of books belonging
to it were more highly honoured and valued than others;
but that the former did not differ in kind but only in the
degree of value attaching both to them and to other books.
In other words, the <em>idea of a Canon</em> assumes the existence of
a number of books from which are selected those which are
to become canonical. Unless this were so we should have
to assume that all the books <em>now</em> regarded as canonical were
so regarded on their first appearance. Our first task in
seeking to substantiate our contention, then, is to give evidence
that at one period the books which were subsequently
admitted into the Canon were distinguished, probably, in
degree, but not in kind, from other books, which were never
admitted into the Canon.</p>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus xliv.-l. Ben-Sira writes a panegyric on the
famous men of old; among these he mentions Moses, to
whom the Lord “gave commandments face to face, even
the Law of life and knowledge” (xlv. 5); Joshua, the “successor
of Moses in prophecies” (xlvi. 1); the Judges, not
individually by name, but collectively (xlvi. 11, 12);
Samuel, “a Nazarite of Jehovah in the prophetical office”
(xlvi. 13)<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>; the Kings, of whom he says, “Except David
and Hezekiah and Josiah, all committed trespass” (xlix. 4);
Isaiah, who “by a spirit of might saw the last things”(xlviii.
24, in the Hebrew); Jeremiah, who “was sanctified in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
womb to be a prophet” (xlix. 6); Ezekiel, “who saw a
vision” (xlix. 8, according to the Hebrew); and the Twelve
Prophets (xlix. 10), these are mentioned collectively, so that
the writings bearing their names had already been collected
into a single book by <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200 or thereabouts. In addition
to these there is a possible reference to the Psalms, though
this is not necessarily the case; the words are: “In every
work of his, David gave thanks to God Most High with words
of glory; with his whole heart he loved his Maker, and sang
praise every day continually. He set music of stringed
instruments before the altar, and arranged the sound of song
to the harp. He glorified the feast-days ...” (xlvii. 8-10,
according to the Hebrew). While the possibility of the
Psalms being here referred to is not denied, one might
reasonably look for something more definite; the reference
could equally well, perhaps more probably, be to the rendering
of the Temple music; it is, at any rate, worth noting
that the chief part of the panegyric on David is taken up with
an account of his heroic acts, (see xlvii. 2-7). Ben-Sira is
more definite in his reference to the Proverbs and Canticles,
though even here this is not necessarily the case, especially
in regard to the latter, for the reference to songs may be
merely taken from 1 Kings iv. 32 (“And his songs were a
thousand and five”); when speaking of Solomon he says:
“With thy songs, and proverbs, and parables, and thine
interpretations thou didst cause astonishment to the peoples”
(xlvii. 17, according to the Hebrew). Job is also mentioned
in the Hebrew, but not in the Greek text; this omission in
the latter can, however, be accounted for, as the translator
either misread or misunderstood the Hebrew. But the
reference to Job does not seem to imply knowledge of the
existence of the Book of Job; the words are: “And also
he (i.e. Ezekiel) made mention of Job (the prophet),<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> who
maintained all the ways of righteousness” (xlix. 9); here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
we have clearly a reference to Ezekiel xiv. 20, where Job
is mentioned as a typically righteous man. Nehemiah is
mentioned by name, and a comparison with Ecclesiasticus
xlvii. 9 (already quoted above), with 1 Chronicles xvi. 4, 5
implies a knowledge of the books of Chronicles. But Ben-Sira
makes no mention of Ezra (there are perhaps special
reasons for this), Daniel, or Esther.</p>

<p>The first point to be noticed in this list is that no place of
honour is assigned to any one collection of books such as the
Hebrew Canon was divided into in later days; the Law, the
Prophets, and some of the “Writings” are all treated as
belonging to the same category. But more: Ben-Sira, in
giving a <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of the history of Israel as contained in these
books, and in enumerating the nation’s worthies, clearly
does not consider that they alone are authoritative, or that
the list of the nation’s worthies, as contained in them, is
exhausted; for he goes on with the history of his nation
during his own time, and continues the list of worthies with
the mention of Simon, the son of Onias, to whom he devotes
far more space than to any of the earlier ones (see l. 1 ff.).
Then, again, while Ben-Sira is familiar with almost all the
books of the Old Testament, he does not regard them as what
we understand by canonical, i.e. in the sense of being separated
off from all other books; for if that had been the case,
he could not have spoken words such as those which occur,
e.g. in xxiv. 33, whereby he places himself in a direct line
with the prophets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And leave it unto eternal generations</div>
    <div class="verse indent17">(see also verses 30-32, 34);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">nor would he have taken upon himself, as Hölscher has
pointedly remarked, to assume the tone and style of the
ancient prophets, as he often does (see, e.g., xlvii. 20, l. 29),
if the “unbridgable cleft of canonicity” had stood between
him and the prophets.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The list, therefore, such as it is, does
not imply the existence of a Canon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>The same must be said of the evidence of Ben-Sira’s
grandson, who translated his grandfather’s work into Greek
(about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 132). He says in his Prologue: “Whereas many
and great things have been delivered unto us by the Law
and the Prophets, and by others that have followed in their
steps ...”; and later on, he again speaks of “the Law, and
the Prophets, and the books of our fathers”; and “the
Law, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books.” The
loose way in which the writer speaks of the third category of
books, and the fact that he does not apply to them the
technical name of <em>Kethubim</em> (“Writings” = <em>Hagiographa</em>) is
clear evidence that what we now understand by the “Hebrew
Canon” was not yet in existence. We may go even further
and say that the Pentateuch, the prophetical books and some
others occupied a position of special honour among many
other books belonging to Hebrew literature,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> but that not
even the Law and the Prophets can have been regarded as
“canonical” in the later sense of the word, otherwise they
would not have been mentioned along with books which
admittedly were not “canonical.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> This is further borne
out by the following words, which occur in the Prologue:
“My grandfather Jesus, having given himself much to the
reading of the Law, and the Prophets, and the other books of
our fathers, and having gained familiarity therein, <em>was
drawn on also himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and wisdom</em>, in order that those who love learning, and
are addicted to these things, might make progress much
more by living according to the Law.” It is obvious from
these words that Ben-Sira’s grandson looked upon his grandfather
as one of those who had “followed after” the writers
of the Law and the Prophets, and that he regarded his
grandfather’s book as having a legitimate place among the
“books of the fathers.” But, this being so, it cannot be
said that the Hebrew Scriptures, or any part of them, were
regarded as canonical in the ordinary sense of the word.
If the Law, the Prophets and other books are treated as a
special body of literature to which a new book can be said to
belong, in the natural and matter of course way in which
Ben-Sira’s grandson does that, it is clear that he, at all events,
did not regard this special body of literature as so sacrosanct
that nothing could be added to it. Therefore, according to
this evidence, there was no “Canon of Scripture,” as we
understand it, as late as about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 132. It follows, then,
further that such books as Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith,
1 Maccabees, and others, were not regarded as “apocryphal,”
but came under the same category of other edifying books,
some of which were, later, made canonical.</p>

<p>But if, as we have seen, there was at this time no such
thing as a Canon of Scripture, in the sense of an officially
recognized and authoritative list of books definitely separated
off from all others, there is no sort of doubt that a certain
number of books were looked upon as pre-eminent, and
enjoyed greater favour than others. It is in this fact that
we may recognize the existence of the <em>idea of a Canon</em>, as
distinct from a finally settled and authoritative list of
canonical books.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVIII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Formation of the Hebrew Canon</span></h4>

<p>But while we have thus an approximate date for the existence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of the <em>idea of a Canon</em>, i.e. the idea that some books are
holier, and therefore more authoritative than others, we have
yet to ask ourselves at what date the definite close of the
Canon took place, i.e. when the Hebrew Canon, as we now
know it, assumed its final form undisputed.</p>

<p>We have evidence that at the beginning of the Christian
era the Hebrew Canon was not yet closed, for at that time
the canonicity of Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs was disputed.
The influential school of Shammai held that these
books were uncanonical, while the school of Hillel acknowledged
their canonicity. Thus, in the Mishna (Jadaim iii. 5)
it is said: “All the holy writings defile the hands.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The
Song of Songs defiles the hands, but regarding Koheleth
(Ecclesiastes) there is a difference of opinion. Rabbi Jose
says, Koheleth does not defile the hands, but regarding the
Song of Songs there is a difference of opinion. Rabbi
Simeon says, As to Koheleth, the house of Shammai esteems
it lightly, but the house of Hillel esteems it highly.” So, too,
in another Mishnic tractate, Eduyoth v. 3, it is said: “Koheleth
does not defile the hands according to the house of
Shammai, but the house of Hillel says that it does defile the
hands.”</p>

<p>At a still later date the canonicity of the Book of Esther
was disputed. Early in the second century of our era two
Rabbis, as recorded in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 100<i>a</i>) regarded
it as of inferior value to the rest of the biblical books.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
But the opposition to this book is not to be taken seriously,
since its canonicity was only disputed by individual teachers.
In the case of Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs it is
different, for the canonicity of these was denied by a whole
school of authoritative teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>It will, therefore, be seen that as late as the beginning of
the Christian era the Hebrew Canon had not been closed, since
there was still the possibility of new books being added to
it, as indeed happened later when the disputed books, just
mentioned, were definitely included in the Canon. So that
the close of the Canon did not take place until some considerable
time after the idea of a Canon had arisen.</p>

<p>From the evidence of the Mishna we turn to an important
passage in Josephus. Writing at about the end of the first
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, Josephus, in his treatise against Apion (i. 8),
after saying that the prophets alone were inspired by God
to write down the earliest events as well as those of their own
times, continues: “We have not myriads of books disagreeing
with, and antagonistic to, one another, but two and
twenty only,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> which contain the record of all time (past), and
are rightly believed in.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> And of these, five belong to Moses;
they contain the laws and the tradition from man’s origin to
his death for a period of nearly three thousand years. From
the death of Moses till the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia,
who reigned after Xerxes, the prophets who came after
Moses wrote down the things that were done during their
time in thirteen books. The remaining four contain hymns
to God and precepts for men’s conduct of life. But from
Artaxerxes to our times all events have, it is true, been
written down; but these later books are not thought to be
worthy of the same credit, because the exact succession of
prophets was wanting.”</p>

<p>According to Josephus, therefore, the canonicity of a book
depended upon whether it had been written within a clearly
defined period, and that period was from Moses to the death
of Artaxerxes, i.e., the prophetical period. The artificiality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
of this test is shown by the fact that, in the words of Ryle,
“the mention of this particular limit seems to be made
expressly with reference to the Book of Esther, in which
alone the Artaxerxes of Josephus (the Ahasuerus of the
Hebrew book of Esther) figures.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> But in pointing to this
test of canonicity, Josephus is not expressing a theory of his
own, for a similar view was held by the Rabbis. They, too,
maintained that no book was canonical unless it had been
written within a fixed period, the prophetical period; for
them this period was from Moses to Ezra.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Josephus thus
witnesses to the principle, authoritative and fully accepted
by the end of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, on the basis of which the
Hebrew Canon was formed. But the theory on which this
principle was based was contrary to fact, for on this view
“there never was or could be any discussion as to the number
and limits of the canonical collection, which had from first
to last an official character. Each new book was written
by a man of acknowledged authority, and was added to the
collection precisely as a new page would be added to the
royal annals of an eastern kingdom. It is plain that this
view is not in accordance with facts.... Josephus’ account
of the Canon is a theory, and a theory inconsistent with the
fact that we find no complete formal catalogue of Scriptures
in earlier writers like the son of Sirach, who, in enumerating
the literary worthies of his nation, had every motive to give
a complete list, if he had been in a position to do so; inconsistent
also with the fact that questions as to the canonicity
of certain books were still undecided within the lifetime of
Josephus himself.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> But wrong and contrary to fact as this
theory was, upon it nevertheless was founded the Hebrew
Canon as we have it at the present day. For various reasons,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
the Rabbis had determined to exclude certain books from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the Canon of the Old Testament,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and their will held the day
not only in their own times, but also reasserted itself, all
unconscious of this though their descendants may be, in
later times in certain parts of the Christian world.</p>

<p>The formation of the Hebrew Canon was thus virtually a
<i lang="fr">fait accompli</i> by about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 100, the official <i lang="la">imprimatur</i> being
in all probability given at what is called the Council of
Jabneh (Jamnia). That this was a council in the ordinary
sense of the word may well be doubted; but there is sufficient
evidence to show that Jabneh was a seat of Jewish
scholarship even before the destruction of the Temple.
After this event the Sanhedrin removed to Jabneh and was
presided over by Jochanan ben Zakkai, the greatest of the
Jewish scribes during the period immediately succeeding
the fall of Jerusalem; he was followed by Gamaliel II. It
must be fairly obvious that any discussions as to the canonicity
of books among the Jewish religious leaders must have
taken place in Jabneh where the Sanhedrin was, and where
the greatest Jewish scholars would be assembled. That such
discussions did take place is amply witnessed to by passages
in the Mishna. So that although it cannot be actually
proved that the final and authoritative formation of the
Hebrew Canon took place at “the council of Jabneh,” it
is reasonably certain from the evidence we have that the
discussions on the canonicity of certain books held by the
Sanhedrin assembled at Jabneh resulted in what came to be
regarded as the formal and official fixing of the Canon.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
How far, in the gradual settlement of the question, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Rabbis acted on their own initiative, and in how far they were
merely registering and crystallizing the popular verdict
articulated by usage is difficult to say. To maintain that
the latter alone was decisive makes it hard to understand why
such books as Ecclesiasticus, Judith and Tobit, to mention
a few of the “apocryphal” books only, were excluded;
on the other hand, we cannot believe that popular usage
counted for nothing. Most probably the whole question
was one of compromise in which by degrees Rabbinical logic,
based upon their theory alluded to above, forced popular
usage to give way to the official position which became
finally and irrevocably fixed by the Sanhedrin at Jabneh.</p>

<p>It is true that long after the council of Jabneh, the canonicity
of Ezekiel, Jonah, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes
and Esther, was at different times called in question<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>; but
this only reflects the opinions of individuals, and cannot be
said to have in any way modified the practical consensus of
Jewish teachers that the final word had been spoken at
Jabneh.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVIII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">To Whom was the Final Fixing of the Hebrew
Canon due?</span></h4>

<p>The question as to whom, pre-eminently, the final fixing
of the Hebrew Canon was due is not without interest; and
although we have no definite proof regarding the matter, all
the probabilities point in the same direction.</p>

<p>It would seem that at the time of Josephus the Pharisees
specially occupied themselves with the subject. It was
Josephus, as we have seen, who is the earliest witness that
we have as to the existence of a finally fixed Canon; now
Josephus, as has been pointed out in an earlier chapter, tells
us in his autobiography that after having made trial of the
three sects of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes in turn,
so that by becoming acquainted with each <ins class="corr" id="tn-174" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'he might chose'">
he might choose</ins><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the best, he finally lived “according to the rule of life of the
sect of the Pharisees.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> This was in his nineteenth year;
so that from early manhood onwards he was a Pharisee.
The fact does not necessarily prove anything; but the presumption
is that he must have got his ideas about the Canon
from the circle of the Pharisees. We have already seen that
Josephus’ theory regarding what constituted the claim for
admission into the Canon was identical with that of the
Rabbis; but by his time the leading Rabbis were Pharisees.</p>

<p>In the next place, we are told in the Mishna (Jadaim iv. 6)
that the Sadducees made fun of the Pharisees for teaching
that the Holy Scriptures “defiled the hands,” while the
books of Homer did not “defile the hands”; that is to say,
the Sadducees repudiated the Pharisaic conception of what
constituted the Canon. This phrase, “to defile the hands,”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
was the Pharisaic way of expressing canonicity; it implied
that the holiness of the sacred object produced by contact
with it a state of Levitical impurity (cp. Lev. vi. 24-28,
Hag. ii. 11-13; and see further the interesting remarks by
Robertson Smith in <cite>The Religion of the Semites</cite> [2nd ed.],
pp. 161, 466 ff.)<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> “The fact that defilement only of <em>the
hands</em> is attributed to the sacred writings demands more
attention than it has hitherto received. Interpreted in
positive terms this can mean only that <em>contact with them
involves a ceremonial washing of the hands</em>, especially as the
ruling in the matter occurs in that Mishna treatise (Jadaim)
which relates to, and is named from, such hand-washings.
The expression would be an unnatural one if it implied a
command that the hands should be washed <em>before</em> touching.
The Pharisees attributed to the sacred writings a sanctity
of such a sort that whosoever touched them was not allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
to touch aught else until he had undergone the same ritual
ablution as if he had touched something unclean.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The record of this difference of opinion between the Pharisees
and Sadducees on this subject throws an interesting light
upon the Pharisaic position regarding the Canon, and suggests
that the final fixing of this lay with this party.</p>

<p>It is also worth recording that prior to Josephus the
attribution of the term “holy” to the Scriptures occurs only
once, viz., in 2 Maccabees viii. 23,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> a book which emanated from
Pharisaic circles<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>; and in the New Testament this occurs
only in the writings of St. Paul,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> who was brought up as a
Pharisee. It is, therefore, probable that the final fixing of
the Canon was due to the Pharisees.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVIII_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>To understand how it came about that a distinct line of
demarcation was drawn between canonical and apocryphal
books, a preliminary consideration is necessary, viz. how
the <em>idea of a Canon</em> arose. We are faced with the fact that
before the beginning of the Christian era there was a large
body of literature in existence some books of which were
held in higher honour than the rest, though they did not
differ in kind, but only in their degree of sacredness, from
these books. It was from this fact that the idea of a Canon
arose; that is to say, the idea of a Canon assumes the existence
of a number of books from which are selected those
which finally become canonical. Between this and the fixing
of a Canon there is clearly a great difference. To show that
a distinction has to be made between the idea of a Canon and
the fixing of the Canon, one has to prove that at one period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
the books which were subsequently admitted into the
Canon were, as we have said, distinguished in degree but not
in kind from the mass of sacred literature.</p>

<p>The evidence of Ben-Sira, and of his grandson, is to the
effect that no fixed Canon of Scripture, as we understand it,
existed at about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 100, and yet we know that at that time
a large mass of literature was in existence of which certain
books were held in high honour. The assumption is, therefore,
justified that such books as Ecclesiasticus, Tobit,
Judith, 1 Maccabees and others came under the same category
as many other books, some of which were later included
in the Canon, and the possibility existed of such books as
those just mentioned being also included in the Canon.</p>

<p>The definite formation of the Hebrew Canon is another
question; concerning this, we have the evidence of the
Mishna that it was not completed at the beginning of the
Christian era. On the other hand, the evidence of Josephus
shows that the final fixing of the Canon had taken place
before the end of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The theory of Josephus, which was also that of the Rabbis,
as to what constituted the claim to canonicity, was that a
book must have been written within the “prophetical
period,” i.e. from Moses to Ezra. This theory was not in
accordance with facts, but it held the field nevertheless, and
the Hebrew Canon was formed in accordance with it. The
final official <i lang="la">imprimatur</i> was in all likelihood given by the
Jewish religious leaders at Jabneh.</p>

<p>The final fixing of the Hebrew Canon was in all probability
the work of the Pharisaic party.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHVIII_NOTE"><span class="smcap">Additional Note</span></h4>

<p><em>The Conceptions underlying the Idea of Levitical Impurity.</em></p>

<p>Although not strictly belonging to the present inquiry,
it may not be out of place to say a few words as to why
contact with a holy object such as a roll of the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
should be conceived of as bringing about a state of Levitical
impurity. Some of the explanations which have been offered
might be convincing if this particular form of the way in
which Levitical impurity was brought about stood alone.
But the fact is that other things involved a similar state of
impurity, and one cannot restrict oneself to the explanation
of one of these while leaving the rest out of consideration,
because, as will be seen in studying the subject, identical
conceptions lie ultimately at the base of all. How, for
example, is one to account for the fact that both the touching
of a holy thing like a scroll of the Law, as well as the touching
of an unclean thing like a leper or a dead body (to mention
no others),<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> was held to bring about a similar state of
Levitical impurity and to require an ablution? That
reverence for the dead could have had nothing to do with
this is proved by the fact that a state of impurity was brought
about not only by contact with a dead person, but equally so
by contact with a dead animal.</p>

<p>When one studies the laws of uncleanness in the Book of
Leviticus and compares them with many customs prevalent
among uncultured races,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> one soon realizes the truth of
Robertson Smith’s words that “the irrationality of laws of
uncleanness, from the standpoint of spiritual religion, or
even of the higher heathenism, is so manifest, that they must
necessarily be looked on as having survived from an earlier
form of faith and of society. And this being so, I do not
see how any historical student can refuse to class them with
savage taboos.”<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Such survivals are to be seen in the laws
of uncleanness in the Book of Leviticus, not that there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
any idea of this when the writer of that book embodied in it
those popular traditional rules and customs which had been
in vogue for millenniums, any more than there was when the
Pharisees decided that certain books should henceforth be
regarded as so holy that the mere touch of them brought about
Levitical impurity; they merely adopted the outward
expression of an antique conception, the essential significance
of which had been forgotten for untold ages.</p>

<p>In primitive religions it was regarded as most dangerous
to touch certain things and persons because they were conceived
of as belonging to, or as being under the protection of,
or indwelt by, spirits; it would be dangerous to touch these
because the spirit’s anger would be aroused thereby, and evil
consequences would ensue; they were, therefore, “taboo.”
But in the dire event of any of these things or persons being
touched by a man, the supernatural essence attaching to
them was communicated; they were “contagious,” and
therefore the unhappy victim who came into contact with
them became “infected.” The result was one of two
things: either the man died,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> or for some (to the savage)
incomprehensible reason no evil consequences ensued. In
the latter case, since by contact the supernatural and dangerous
essence adhered to the man, it was necessary that some
means should be found whereby this “infection” should be
obliterated, otherwise the “infected” person would be a
danger to the community and would himself continue in the
unfortunate position of being debarred from intercourse with
his fellows. Various means were devised whereby this
infection, conceived of as something tangible, could be got
rid of. Among these there was the obvious one of washing
it away with water.</p>

<p>But the tabooed things and persons referred to were of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
very diverse character; some, such as a carcase, we should
certainly consider polluted or unclean; others, such as the
priestly vestments, we should call holy; but each was regarded
as “infectious,” in the sense used above, even in the
Old Testament.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> This is but an echo of ideas which obtained
among the forbears of the Israelites in distant bygone
ages; it may be illustrated by the condition of thought, in
this respect, among men of low culture at the present day.
Frazer, in dealing with the subject of “holy” persons<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> (and
the principle of what he says applies likewise to “holy”
things), says, that so far as the savage is concerned, “the
conceptions of holiness and pollution are not yet differentiated
in his mind. To him the common feature of all these
persons is that they are dangerous and in danger, and the
danger in which they stand and to which they expose others
is what we should call spiritual or ghostly.... To seclude
these persons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded
spiritual danger shall neither reach them, nor spread from
them, is the object of the taboos which they have to observe.
These taboos act, so to say, as electrical insulators to preserve
the spiritual force with which these persons are
charged from suffering or inflicting harm by contact with
the outer world.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> To man in a low state of culture, then,
the distinction between the conceptions of what we speak of
as holiness and uncleanness does not exist; but as soon as a
higher form of religion comes into being that distinction
begins to be discerned, especially as with any form of religion
higher than that which obtains in the animistic stage the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
conception of a god begins to assert itself. Thus, to utilize
(quite hypothetically) the instances given above, in the lower
stage a carcase would be regarded as “holy,” i.e. something
to be avoided, because it was thought of as possessed by
malignant spirits; a medicine man’s belongings would be
regarded as “holy,” i.e. something to be avoided, just because
they were the medicine man’s; both are uncanny
things, inspiring mysterious fear; both impart “infection”
and are therefore dangerous. This it is which, to the mind
of the savage, puts both in the same category. With the rise
of a higher religion the carcase would come to be regarded as
“unclean,” while a priest’s vestments (corresponding for the
purposes of our present argument to the medicine man’s
utensils) would come to be regarded as “holy” in a higher
sense. But, and this is the important point, both would
still be avoided; the former because the touch of it involved
pollution, and thus unfitted a man for the worship of his
god; the latter for reasons of reverence due to his god.
But in both cases the result of the old idea of “infection”
still clung, so that contact with either necessitated a cleansing
process of some kind. The persistence of the ritual,
though the purpose of it has been forgotten, is a fairly
common phenomenon even among the most highly cultured
peoples; only, since among these a “reason why” is insisted
upon sooner or later, plausible explanations, though far
removed from the origin of things, are usually forthcoming.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>That is how the special case before us is to be explained.
The idea of a Canon presupposes a wide literature from which
the “canonical” books are to be marked off; a working
theory having been formulated, the Canon is constructed in
accordance with it; the Canon having been constructed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
some means of enforcing its recognition must be devised.
To the Rabbis of two thousand years ago, the quite obvious
means would be the adaptation of a principle which had been
in vogue in the whole domain of things religious from time
immemorial. “Sacredness” was imputed to the chosen
books; and contact with anything sacred necessitated
ablutions. The ancient technical term was still employed,
so that any book declared to be “sacred” (and, of course, the
“sanctity” would be communicated to the material upon
which it was written) was said to “defile,” in this case the
hands; and therefore anyone who touched such a book was
“defiled” thereby. Theoretically he had to perform an
ablution after having done so, but only theoretically, for as a
matter of fact no washing of hands (more strictly, pouring of
water upon the hands) has ever been required for removing
the “defilement” communicated through touching the
scroll of a canonical book, nor is it required at the present
day.</p>

<h4 id="PI_CHIX_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Meaning of the Term</span> <em>Gānaz</em>.</h4>

<p class="drop-capy">For reasons which will appear sufficiently obvious as
we proceed, it is necessary, in speaking about uncanonical
books, to say something about the meaning of
the Hebrew word <em>gānaz</em>, “to hide,” and the Greek word
<em>apokryphos</em>, “hidden,” and the relationship of these terms
to one another. The word <em>Apocrypha</em> means “hidden
things”; but in what sense and for what purpose is, or
was, this term applied to those books which we call the books
of the Apocrypha? That is one of the main points to be
dealt with in the following discussion.</p>

<p>First as to the Hebrew word <em>gānaz</em>; this means originally
“to store up,” but it also has the meaning “to store up in
secret,” and thus “to hide.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> In the technical sense in
which it is used in the present connection, i.e. in reference
to books, it means “to withdraw from use.” But, it may
be pointed out in passing, the word was not used in this
sense prior to the fixing of the Hebrew Canon; it referred
to the withholding of secret wisdom from all excepting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
initiated. The question as to how the word is used in
the Talmud is of the first importance, but a difficult one;
it is said, on the one hand, that as applied to books, “it
is used only of books which are, after all, included in the
Jewish Canon, never of the kind of literature to which the
Church Fathers give the name ‘Apocrypha’... the only
exception is a reference to Sirach.”<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> The latter part of
this statement is undoubtedly true; but Hölscher has
shown conclusively that to say that <em>gānaz</em> is only used
in reference to books which are included in the Jewish
Canon is not in accordance with the facts. “This view,”
he says, “directly contradicts the sources, which in a number
of cases use <em>gānaz</em> in reference to uncanonical books.” He
shows further that when the Rabbis use <em>gānaz</em> in reference
to the canonical books it is a question of something of which
they themselves disapprove; for example, they speak
of canonical books which in time past certain people had
desired to “hide,” i.e. to declare uncanonical; but they
mention this in order to record their disapproval; not
the Rabbis but certain unnamed individuals apply the
term <em>gānaz</em> to canonical books. The Talmudic view is that
canonical books may <em>not</em> be “hidden,” for this is only done
in the case of books which are really offensive.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> In the
only other instances in which the word is used in reference
to canonical books, it is not to the books as such, but only to
particular copies of them, and this for certain specific
reasons; for example, if a roll had become moth-eaten or
damaged in other ways, or if part of the text had been
rubbed out through use; in such cases the copy in question
was “hidden,” i.e. withdrawn from public use, because
there was something objectionable about it. So that in
the Talmud <em>gānaz</em> implies, as Hölscher says, “drastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
action,” the total withdrawal from public use, and therefore
it cannot have been used in reference to the canonical books,
for in that case it would have implied their excision from
the Canon, a “naturally impossible thought for the Rabbis.”
The books which the Rabbis “hide” (<em>gānaz</em>) and forbid
are always such the contents of which were regarded as
thoroughly objectionable, viz., heretical.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It follows also
that <em>gānaz</em> would never have been applied to the books of
our Apocrypha, or at all events to the more important
of them, for not only were they regarded as containing
edifying and orthodox teaching, but it is well known that
the reading of them was permitted.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> So that when the
word <em>gānaz</em> is used in the Talmud in reference to books it
means that the books in question are such as must be withdrawn
from use because they contain heretical teaching<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>;
for this reason the word would be inapplicable if applied to
the books of the Hebrew Canon or to the books of our
Apocrypha.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIX_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Meaning of the Term</span> <em>Apokryphos</em></h4>

<p>We turn next to the Greek word <em>apokryphos</em> (“hidden”),
from which our word Apocrypha comes. The term, in its
technical sense, is neither specifically Jewish nor Christian
originally, but “is derived from the practice common
among sects, religious or philosophic, of embodying their
special tenets or <em>formulæ</em> in books withheld from public
use, and communicated to an inner circle of believers.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
Examples of such books can be given; a magical <i>papyrus</i>
preserved in Leyden has the title “The holy and secret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
(<em>apokryphos</em>) Book of Moses, called the eighth or the holy.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
According to Suidas, Therecydes of Syros learned his wisdom
from “the secret books of the Phœnicians.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Clement of
Alexandria (Strom., i. 15, 69) speaks of an Agnostic sect, the
followers of Prodicus, who gloried in the possession of
secret books of Zoroaster.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Irenaeus (I, xx. 1) mentions
an early Christian sect called the Markosians who had their
secret books, and Hippolytus (Refut., vii. 20) says the same
of the Basilidians.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Moreover, we have references to the
same kind of thing in books which have come down to us;
it is said in Daniel xii. 4, “But thou, O Daniel, shut up (lit.
‘hide’) the words, and seal the book, ...” and in xii. 9,
“Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are shut (lit. ‘hidden’)
and sealed till the time of the end.” In the Ethiopic Book
of Enoch (cviii. 1)<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> reference is made to a book which was
written for the elect: “Another book which Enoch wrote
for his son Methuselah and for those who will come after
him and will keep the Law in the last days”; the same
seems to be implied in the Slavonic Book of Enoch (lxviii. 2),<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
where it is said: “He wrote down the descriptions of all the
creation which the Lord had made, and he wrote three
hundred and sixty-six books, and gave them to his sons.”
Still more pointed is the passage in 2 (4) Esdras xii. 36-38<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>:
“Thou alone hast been found worthy to learn this mystery
of the Most High; therefore write all these things which thou
hast seen in a book, and put them in a secret place; and
thou shalt teach them to the wise of the people, whose
hearts thou knowest are able to comprehend and keep these
mysteries.” But perhaps the most striking passage of all is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
2 (4) Esdras xiv. 44-47: “So in forty days were written
ninety-four books. And it came to pass when the forty
days were fulfilled, that the Most High spake unto me,
saying: The twenty-four books which thou hast written
publish, that the worthy and unworthy may read therein;
but the seventy last thou shalt keep, to deliver them to
the wise among thy people; for in them is the spring of
understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of
knowledge.” The “twenty-four books” are the canonical
ones which were read in the synagogue and therefore known
to all, but the “seventy last” are the secret ones which are
reserved only for the initiated.</p>

<p>From these passages it will, therefore, be seen that
originally the term “apocryphal,” as applied to books, was
used in a good sense; such books were held to contain deep
and mysterious truths which might only be communicated
to the initiated, and were therefore hidden from the outside
world; this applies both to Gentile and to Jewish usage.
It will also have been noticed, from the passages quoted,
that there is a twofold idea contained in the term “apocryphal”;
it means, on the one hand, hidden teaching which
the book contains, and on the other, that the book itself
is hidden.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Neither in the passages quoted, nor anywhere
else, is the word “apocryphal” ever applied to the books
of our Apocrypha; this is true right up to the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Before pursuing further the history of the word “apocryphal,”
and how it came to be applied to sacred books of the
second rank, we must briefly consider the not unimportant
question of the connection between the Hebrew <em>gānaz</em> and
the Greek <em>apokryphos</em>. It is better to do so at this point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
before we deal with <em>apokryphos</em> in the later sense in which
it was used.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIX_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Connection between the Terms</span> <em>Gānaz</em> <span class="allsmcap">AND</span>
<em>Apokryphos</em></h4>

<p>We have seen that <em>gānaz</em> is only used, properly speaking,
of objectionable books, i.e. those which were regarded as
heretical, and therefore “hidden,” or “withdrawn.” We
have also seen that <em>apokryphos</em> is used in a good sense of
books which contain “hidden” teaching, and must therefore
be “hidden” from the unworthy. This would seem
to imply that there could have been no connection between the
two terms since they refer respectively to books the character
of which is diametrically opposed, <em>gānaz</em> being applied to bad
books, <em>apokryphos</em> to good ones. But here another factor
comes in. From the root <em>gānaz</em> comes the word <em>Genizah</em>;
this name was applied to a small chamber, adjoining the
ancient synagogues, in which were kept hidden away those
rolls of the Scriptures which after continued use at the
synagogue services began to show signs of wear and tear.
It was a laudable custom among the Jews that whatsoever
was used in the service of God should be of the best; so
that when a roll of the Scriptures had been in use for a
certain number of years and had become tarnished or torn,
they did not consider it fit to be used in divine service.
On the other hand, the roll contained Holy Scripture, and
had also been sanctified by service; it was, therefore,
unfitting that it should be thrown away. For this reason
it was placed in the <em>Genizah</em>, and thus hidden away from
profane hands.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Here, then, we have another reason for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
which books were “hidden,” though it applies in the main
to canonical books (see below); at the same time it must
be remembered that the technical term <em>gānaz</em> is not used
in reference to books in this connection. But then we
have this further important fact; it was not only damaged
copies of the Scriptures which were placed in the <em>Genizah</em>;
as Prof. Schechter says: “Another class of works consigned
to the <em>Genizah</em> were what we may call disgraced books,
books which once pretended to the rank of Scriptures,
but were found by the authorities to be wanting in the
qualification of being dictated by the Holy Spirit. They
were ‘hidden.’”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The <em>Genizah</em>, therefore, as it has been
well put, served “the twofold purpose of preserving
good things from harm, and bad things from harming.”<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
This, therefore, suggests a distinct connection between the
ideas conveyed by the terms <em>gānaz</em> and <em>apokryphos</em>. Such
connection is, moreover, confirmed by the witness of Origen,
(d. 254 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), who, together with Africanus, his contemporary,
was the first to apply the term “apocryphal”
to books used by the Church; Origen expressly says that
he borrowed his terminology from the Jews<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>; and, as
Hölscher has shown, his use of <em>apokryphos</em> entirely corresponds
with the Rabbinical use of <em>gānaz</em>; both use these
terms in reference, not to the canonical books, nor to the
books of our Apocrypha, but to the books known as “Pseudepigrapha.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
These latter books were condemned by the
Rabbis after the Canon had been fixed (though this had not
always been the case) because they were looked upon as
harmful; but in the early Church they were freely used. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
though <em>gānaz</em> and <em>apokryphos</em> are thus shown to express
similar ideas, as technical terms they are obviously not to be
thought of as meaning the same thing. Originally they
did in all probability connote similar ideas, viz., the hiding
of secret wisdom from all but those who were fit to receive
it; but that was before the Canon was fixed and when
the line of demarcation between different categories of
books was not so rigid. Both terms originated independently;
<em>apokryphos</em> continued, anyhow up to the time of
Origen, to be applied in reference to books which contained
hidden wisdom; <em>gānaz</em>, on the other hand, while being
originally used in the same way as <em>apokryphos</em>, came to be
used in quite a different way; it always meant “to hide,”
but while originally it referred to the hiding of what was
good,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> it was finally used in reference to what was bad.
The term did not change, but its meaning did.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIX_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">How the Term “Apocrypha” came to be Applied
to Sacred Books of the Second Rank</span></h4>

<p>But we must return to the question as to why the term
Apocrypha was applied to the books which we include under
that title. As we have seen, “apocryphal” was first applied
to books which contained hidden wisdom; then it was used
by Origen in reference to pseudepigraphic books. In the
fourth century the attempt was first made (in the Greek
Church) to distinguish between canonical books and those
which were read for edification; the latter referred to the
books of our Apocrypha, but the term apocryphal was
still applied only to pseudepigraphic books. The example
of the Greek Church was followed by the Latin Church
headed by St. Jerome (d. <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 420) who made a distinction
between the “libri canonici” and the “libri ecclesiastici,”
meaning by the latter term the books of the Apocrypha.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
It was not arbitrariness which prompted St. Jerome to
do this; the Latin Church was in the fourth century inundated
with a flood of religious writings hitherto unknown
outside the Greek Church; these now appeared in Latin
translations. Their appearance in the West created a
great sensation, the more so as they bore in their titles
names which were greatly honoured.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> They were not
all good for the faithful to read, yet only too frequently
there was no sufficiently learned churchman at hand to
give guidance. In St. Jerome’s time, therefore, there was
a mass of literature in circulation which was used without
discrimination; so that it needed someone of learning
and authority to guide and direct. To this fact was no
doubt largely due St. Jerome’s activity in this matter, and
he commenced by making a clear distinction between the
canonical books and those of the second rank to which he
now gave the name of apocryphal.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> But stress must
be laid upon the fact that he used the word “apocryphal”
in a new sense. Hitherto, as we have seen, this
word was applied to the Pseudepigrapha and to other
extra-canonical books; St. Jerome was the first to use it in
reference to the books which are now included in the Apocrypha,
i.e. in the sense in which it is now used. This new
use of the term did not at once become general; St. Augustine
(d. <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 430), for example, uses “apocrypha”
in the old sense in his <cite lang="la">De Civitate Dei</cite>, xv. 23; but by degrees
St. Jerome’s nomenclature was adopted throughout the
West, and this has continued to the present time. Thus
it has come about that we call the sacred books of the second
rank the Apocrypha, though there is not, nor ever has been,
anything “hidden” about them or their teaching.</p>

<h4 id="PI_CHIX_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Reading of Uncanonical Books</span></h4>

<p>We shall deal in detail with the books of the Apocrypha
in Part II, and some account of the Pseudepigrapha will
be given in the next chapter; here we purpose to say something
about the early use of uncanonical “books,” apart
from the two categories just mentioned, during the period
with which we are mainly concerned, i.e. roughly <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200-<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
100.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the idea of a Canon presupposes
the existence of a number of books from which those to
be included in the Canon are selected. So that before the
formation of the Canon a variety of books was in existence
among the Jews, the reading of which was not forbidden.
This continued until after the Canon had been finally fixed,
though it was not long before <em>all</em> uncanonical books, with
the exception of some of those which belong to our Apocrypha,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
were forbidden. Rabbi Akiba, for example, who lived
towards the end of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> and during the
first half of the second, reckoned among such as had no
portion in the world to come those who read “outside
books”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>; these were called <em>Sepharim hachizônim</em>, the
latter word being equivalent to the Greek οἱ ἔξω, which
is used in the New Testament of persons “that are without,”
i.e. outside the company of the faithful.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> In Jewish
writings the <em>Sepharim hachizônim</em> are synonymous with
<em>Sifre hamînîm</em>, “the books of the heretics.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The Rabbis
regarded such books with the greatest horror; it is said of
Rabbi Tarphon, a contemporary of Rabbi Akiba, that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
burned every book belonging to the <cite>Minim</cite> which he could
get hold of; he went so far as to say that if a man was being
pursued by a murderer or a serpent it would be better to
take refuge in the house of an idolater than in that of a
heretic.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> We deal with the subject of these books in the
next chapter. It is often asked what <em>data</em> we have for
believing in the existence of the wide prevalence of “books”
in these early ages; as the question is not without importance
in the present connection it will not be out of
place to indicate some of the <em>data</em>. We may refer first to
Ecclesiastes xii. 11, 12: “The words of the wise are as
goads, and as driven nails are the members of collections;
they are given by one shepherd. And besides these, my
son, be warned. Of making many books there is no end, and
much study is a weariness of the flesh.” What the preacher
here means is that the words of the wise stimulate the
reader to good thoughts; the words “members of collections”
refer to wise words which have been embodied in
collections of sayings; all these come from God, the one
Shepherd. A warning is then given as to the reading of
other literature; “the editor would deter his pupils from
unorthodox or heathen literature by the thought of the
weariness of study.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The passage shows that there must
have been a quantity of unorthodox literature available.
“Books” of another character were Aramaic Targums
which were certainly much in use in pre-Christian times<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
as well as later; these are often referred to in the Talmud.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
It is said in one of the Midrashic<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> works that when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Israelites were in Egypt they possessed rolls in the reading
of which they delighted every Sabbath; the statement is,
of course, merely pictorial, but it implies the spread of
literature—though, to be sure, at a much later time than
that referred to. Among “books” mentioned by name
are the following<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>: “Megillath Taanith,” which enumerates
and discusses fast-days which should not be observed as
fasts because joyful events occurred on them in days gone
by; this probably belongs to the first century of our era.
Of about the same date is “The roll of Genealogies”;
what the precise contents of this work were is not known, as
only one quotation occurs in the Talmud, in the tractate
Jebamoth 49<i>b</i>. Rabbi Jochanan ben Nuri, a contemporary
of Rabbi Akiba, possessed, we are told, a “Megillath Sammānim”
(“The roll of powders”), in which is given a list
of spices used for making incense; this, it is said, was an
heirloom belonging to the “house of Abtinas.” Rabbi Chijja
(third century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) had a “book” called “Megillath
Sethārim” (“The roll of hidden things”), in this he wrote
down precepts and the like which, it is said, did not receive
general approval. Besides these Strack gives references to
a large number of Haggadic<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and Halakic<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> “books” which
need not be enumerated here.</p>

<p>But the most striking proof of the existence of “books”
in more or less general use is afforded by the recently
found<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Aramaic <i>papyri</i> of Elephantiné (belonging to the fifth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). We have already referred to these,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and shall
have to speak in some detail about one of these <i>papyri</i> in
dealing with the Book of Tobit; but, so far as we are now
concerned, the main fact is worth recording that centuries
before the beginning of the Christian era numbers of Aramaic
<i>papyri</i> were to be found in private houses; the contents
of these <i>papyri</i> varied from household accounts and
<i>memoranda</i> to such a story as “The history of the wise
Achikar.”<a id="FNanchor_273a" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>These various “books” which have been briefly referred to—and
they represent but a small number of the available
<em>data</em>—are sufficient evidence to show that there was a considerable
amount of literary material for use among those
who desired it. The question may be asked whether in
these early days there were so many people able to read
as to make the wide distribution of literature likely; it
may be replied that probably there was a larger percentage
of men among the Jews able to read and write than
among any other nation during the period of which we are
speaking. But, as a matter of fact, the actual number,
whether small or great, of those able to read was not the
important point; for where one read and expounded, there
were a number who would listen, and thus be influenced
by the contents of a “book.” We have an interesting
example of this in Ecclesiasticus l. 29, where, according to
the Hebrew text, Ben-Sira speaks of those who attended
his <em>Yeshibah</em>, i.e. lecture-room or academy; there can be
little doubt that Ben-Sira’s book (Ecclesiasticus) formed
part of the instruction there given.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> But as Ben-Sira speaks
of the <em>Yeshibah</em> as a well known institution we may be sure
that others existed.</p>

<p>In one way or another, then, men became acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
with and were influenced by the contents and teaching of
“books”; and when a distinction had come to be made
between “books” which were permitted and “books”
which were forbidden, a strict vigilance was kept by the
religious authorities in order to suppress unorthodox
“books.” Among these unorthodox “books” there was
one class which was regarded as very dangerous, and therefore
strictly forbidden, viz. those which dealt with the
subject of Apocalypse; to these some attention must next
be devoted.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHIX_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>The Hebrew root <em>gānaz</em> and the Greek word <em>apokryphos</em>
must be properly understood if the subject of canonical and
uncanonical books is to be discussed. Originally, <em>gānaz</em>
meant “to store up,” and then “to store up in secret,”
thus “to hide,” and especially to hide secret wisdom from
the masses; later, it came to have the technical sense,
in reference to books, of “withdrawing from use.” The
Talmudic use of the term is important; when there used
in reference to books it means that such books, on account
of their heretical teaching, must be withdrawn from public
use; the word is never, in the Talmud, used of canonical
books themselves nor of the books of our Apocrypha.</p>

<p>The Greek word <em>apokryphos</em> had in its origin, as a technical
term, a meaning somewhat similar to <em>gānaz</em> in its early,
though not in its later, connotation; it was used of books
containing secret teaching only to be communicated to
the initiated. <em>Apokryphos</em> was, therefore, used first in a
good sense; the “hidden” character of “apocryphal”
books consisted in their being hidden from the outside world
for which they were too good. But in its later usage <em>apokryphos</em>
also corresponded to the later usage of <em>gānaz</em>; both
were used in reference to uncanonical books; but these
books were not merely uncanonical, they were also heretical,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
namely those which we now include under the term “Pseudepigrapha”;
neither term was originally used of the books
of our Apocrypha.</p>

<p>It was not until the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and in the Greek
Church first, that a distinction began to be made between
canonical books and books which, though not canonical, were
nevertheless to be read for edification, i.e. the books of our
Apocrypha. But even then the term “apocryphal”
continued to be used only in reference to heretical books,
and not to those of our Apocrypha.</p>

<p>The fundamental change in the use of the term apocryphal
was brought about by St. Jerome; owing to the influx,
during the fourth century, of a number of religious writings
from the Eastern Church, many of which it was thought
better to withhold from the faithful, St. Jerome drew a
sharper distinction than had obtained hitherto in the West
between the canonical and other writings; he now applied
the term “apocryphal” to the books of our present Apocrypha,
and though this new connotation of the term did not
at once become general, it was by degrees adopted and has
continued ever since.</p>

<p>There were many uncanonical books, in addition to
the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, the reading of
which was not forbidden prior to the formation of the
Canon; but later, all books outside the Canon, with the
exception of some belonging to our Apocrypha, were forbidden;
they were called books “that are without.”
Many <em>data</em> regarding the existence of books, apart from
Scriptural ones, among the Jews in pre-Christian times are
available; from these it is evident that there must have
been much literary activity. As these books were varied
in character and did not by any means necessarily always
contain orthodox teaching, the fact of their existence illustrates
the need of the discrimination which the Jewish
religious authorities saw fit to exercise.</p>

<span class="fs135">Uncanonical Books (II). The Apocalyptic Literature</span></h3>

<p class="pfs90">[<span class="smcap">Literature.</span>—See the headings to the various sections.]</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHX_PRE"><span class="smcap">Preliminary Remarks</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">Uncanonical books of a sacred character came to be
divided by the Jewish religious authorities into two
categories, though the exact dividing line varied according
to the opinions of different teachers. These two categories
consisted, on the one hand, of books which contained orthodox
teaching, but which, for one reason or another, were not
admitted into the Canon; roughly speaking, under this category
were included the books of our Apocrypha. The other
category consisted of what were regarded as heretical books.
The former, though they did not “defile the hands,” were
permitted to be read. The latter came to be regarded with
horror, and the reading of them was strictly forbidden; they
were called <em>Sepharim hachizônim</em>, “Outside Books,” to
which reference has been made in the preceding chapter;
when precisely this term came to be applied to them we cannot
say, but it is evident that the feeling in regard to them
expressed by the term was in existence before <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 100.</p>

<p>Now among the “Outside Books” were those which were
called <em>Ha-Gilyônim</em>. There is some difference of opinion
among scholars as to the meaning of this term and as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
what kind of books it refers; Hölscher has, however, as it
appears to us, shown conclusively that by it was meant
“The Apocalypses,” and that it refers to what we now know
as the Apocalyptic Literature.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> There is no doubt that the
whole of this literature was rejected, ultimately, by the
Palestinian Jewish authorities, the Pharisees.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Strongly as
the Pharisees had been influenced by some of the teaching
contained in this literature, they had from their point of
view sufficient reason to discountenance the books as a whole.
The pronounced other-worldly character of them was in
marked contrast to the strictly practical and narrow purview
of scholastic Pharisaism. The scant insistence on the
need of legal observance, in the Pharisaic sense, which to the
Pharisees was the basis of all religion, was a natural cause of
antagonism; and this antagonism inevitably widened as
time went on, for there was a danger that the popularity
of the apocalyptic books would relegate the older religious
literature to the background; indeed, we have definite proof
that in some circles the apocalyptic literature was held in
higher esteem than the canonical twenty-four; thus in
2 (4) Ezra xiv. 45-47 it is said: “And it came to pass when
the forty days were fulfilled, that the Most High spoke unto
me saying, The twenty-four books that thou hast written
publish, that the worthy and unworthy may read them; but
the seventy last [i.e. the apocalyptic books] thou shalt
keep, to deliver them to the wise among thy people. For
in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of
wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.” There was possibly
a further cause of hostility to some of these books, viz.
their <em>original</em> authorship, which in some cases was Sadducæan;
in such cases, although worked over by Pharisaic
editorship the Sadducæan trail could not be altogether
obliterated; hence their condemnation. Highly improbable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
as this sounds at first, it will be seen, when we come to
consider these books in brief detail, that in some cases the
contention is not altogether unjustified.</p>

<p>It is doubtless due to this Pharisaic hostility that almost
all the Hebrew or Aramaic originals of these books have
disappeared and that these writings are preserved only in
translations. There can, moreover, be little doubt that this
hostility was further nourished on account of the use of
apocalyptic books in the early Christian Church.</p>

<p>Another preliminary remark about this literature is necessary.
All the known books belonging to it have false names
in their titles, for which reason they are called the <em>Pseudepigrapha</em>.
How are we to account for this apparent fraud
on the part of writers who were clearly devout and earnest
men? This strange procedure, as it appears to us nowadays,
may to a large extent be explained if we remember that
“the apocalyptic writers almost certainly drew their material
from popular tradition. Many of the ideas which receive
various embodiment in this literature were derived doubtlessly
from the common stock of the popular consciousness;
their ascription to or association with the great heroic figures
of antiquity, like Enoch, Abraham, Isaiah, or the twelve
Patriarchs, may also be a feature from the popular consciousness.
The men who reduced the various elements to writing,
or utilized them for enforcing religious views or lessons
may, on this view, be acquitted from any charge of fraud
or dishonesty; they implicitly trusted the popular tradition
so far as to believe that the ideas to which they were giving
expression really did go back to the heroic figures of old.
Their estimate, moreover, of the function and importance
of authorship probably differed fundamentally from that
of the moderns; it was far less self-conscious, and was the
natural outcome of a literary modesty which was <i lang="fr">naïve</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>It is likely enough that one way whereby the popular
traditions came into being was owing to Haggadic homiletics,
i.e. the explanation of Scripture teaching by narrative or
parable; passages of Scripture would be explained and
illustrated by means of imaginary narratives which were, of
course, not intended to be other than explanatory; then,
as these were repeated and handed on, they tended in process
of time to be regarded as accounts of events which actually
did happen, and which had been handed down by tradition.
If this supposition be correct, it would in some sense be
analogous to the somewhat similar process which happened in
the domain of Halakah, i.e. that which is concerned with the
legal and ritual elements in Scripture.</p>

<p>A brief examination of these apocalyptic books is demanded
here inasmuch as in the early Church—and in all probability
in the pre-Christian Jewish Church at one time—the
distinct line of demarcation between them and those of the
Apocrypha was not drawn in the way that it was in later
times. It is also worth noting that such books as the Book
of Enoch, and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs have,
as Charles has shown,<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> exercised more influence upon the
writers of the New Testament than any of the books of the
Apocrypha.</p>

<p>In giving now some short account of the more important
books belonging to this body of literature, we shall take them,
as far as possible, in chronological order; but, as is to be
expected, one cannot always be certain as to the date of a
book, so that we cannot claim to be sure that a strictly
chronological order is being followed.</p>

<p>Chapter cv., which consists only of two verses, cannot be
dated; while cviii. is, according to Charles, an appendix to
the entire work.</p>

<p>While these dates may be regarded as approximately correct,
it should be pointed out that there is not a complete consensus
of opinion among scholars on the subject. Schürer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
for example, holds that the entire book, with the exception
of chapters xxxvii.-lxxi., was written during the period <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
130-100, these other chapters being not earlier than the time
of Herod the Great. Beer thinks that the “Dream Visions”
belong to the time of John Hyrcanus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 135-105), and he
includes under the pre-Maccabæan portions only xci. 12-17,
xcii., xciii. 1-14; but he agrees with Charles in thinking
that the book as a whole belongs to a period prior to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 64.
Dalman maintains that it cannot be proved that the important
section xxxvii.-lxxi. (“The Similitudes”) is “the product
of the pre-Christian period,” though he fully recognizes
its Jewish character.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>As to the question of authorship; since the book is made
up of sections belonging to various dates, it is obvious that
unity of authorship is not to be looked for. But if there is
not unity, there is, so Charles maintains, uniformity of
authorship; for, according to him, all the sections were
written by <em>Chassidim</em>, or by their successors, the Pharisees.
An entirely different view of authorship has, however, recently
been put forth with much skill by Leszynsky.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
While frankly recognizing the composite character of the
book, he holds that the original portions of it (according to
him these are: i.-xxxvi., lxxii.-lxxxii., lxxxiii.-xc., xciii. xci.
12-17) to have emanated from Sadducæan circles, and that
the special object of the book in its original form was that of
bringing about the reform of the calendar.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He points first
of all to the ascription of the book to Enoch as supporting
his contention; Enoch lived 365 years, i.e. his years correspond
to the number of days in the solar year, which, as we
have seen, was one of the fundamental differences between
the Sadducees and Pharisees, these latter reckoning time
by the lunar year. Further, Enoch ascended into the
heavens and would therefore be just the one to know all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
about the heavenly luminaries; he was thus the most appropriate
author of a book which was to deal with astronomical
questions. “The Sadducæan character of the original
work,” says Leszynsky, “is seen most clearly in the discussion
regarding the calendar; chapter lxxii.-lxxxii. are
rightly called the Book of Astronomy<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>: ‘the book of the
courses of the luminaries of the heaven, the relations of
each, according to their classes, their dominion and their
seasons, according to their names and places of origin, and
according to their months ... with regard to all the years
of the world and unto eternity, till the new creation is accomplished
which endureth till eternity’ (lxxii. 1). That sounds
almost as though the author of the Book of Jubilees had
written it. That it is not a merely scientific interest which
impels the writer to give expression to his astronomical
theories may be seen from the words at the conclusion of the
section: ‘Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those
who walk in the way of righteousness, and sin not as the
sinners in the reckoning of all their days, in which the sun
traverses the heaven, entering into and departing from the
portals for thirty days ...’ (lxxxii. 4-7). Herein one
can discern quite clearly the tendency of the writer. He
desires the adoption of the solar year, while his contemporaries
wrongly followed a different reckoning and therefore
celebrated the feasts at the wrong time. The ‘sinners who
sin in the reckoning of the year’ are the Pharisees; and
the righteous ones who are blessed, the <em>Zaddîkim</em>,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> who walk
upon the paths of righteousness (<em>Zedek</em>), as the name was
made to imply, were the Sadducees.” Leszynsky works
out his argument in much detail, the study of the whole of
which is necessary to grasp the full force of his contention.
The other portions of the book he does not hold to be Sadducæan.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
In the concluding portion he sees a bitter polemic
by a Pharisee against the Sadducees (see especially cii. 6 ff.).
Regarding the important section called the “Similitudes”
(xxxvii.-lxxi.) Leszynsky has nothing definite to suggest other
than that it is not Christian, still less Jewish. He says: “We
know too little about the sects which existed about the time
of the beginning of Christianity to be able to say to what circle
the author of this writing belonged.”</p>

<p>The contentions of Charles and Leszynsky are thus diametrically
opposed. To the present writer the great difficulty
in accepting either as it stands lies in the fact that,
broadly speaking, the Apocalyptic Literature, of which the
Book of Enoch is the most striking example we possess, was
acceptable to neither Pharisees nor Sadducees. No doubt
Charles is right in assigning the earlier portions of the book
(i.e. the pre-Maccabæan) to the <em>Chassidim</em>; but we have
sought, in an earlier chapter,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> to show that Friedländer is
justified in maintaining that the <em>Chassidim</em> were the forbears
of both Apocalyptists and Pharisees, two branches of the
parent stock which diverged widely in spite of some fundamental
points of family likeness. The Book of Enoch,
therefore, may, in its pre-Maccabæan portions, well be
ascribed to the <em>Chassidim</em>; but it is not on that account
necessary to ascribe all the later portions to the Pharisees;
three points especially militating against this: the Messianic
doctrine, the, generally speaking, universalistic spirit, and
the attitude to the Law not being the Pharisaic one.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The
Apocalyptists, on the other hand, were also the descendants
of the <em>Chassidim</em>; and no sufficient reason exists for not
ascribing the bulk of the later portions of our book to them.
Regarding Leszynsky’s view, while we feel that that part of
it is justified which ascribes to the Sadducees the “Book of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Astronomy” (lxxii.-lxxxii.) and possibly certain other portions,
there is a grave difficulty in regarding such parts as
i.-xxxvi. and xciii., xci. 12-17, in which the apocalyptic
element is prominent, as of Sadducæan origin, for nothing
that we know of the Sadducees leads us to suppose that they
cultivated apocalyptic studies. What we feel to be of
extreme importance in assigning authorship to Jewish books
belonging to the last two pre-Christian centuries is the fact
well expressed by Friedländer: “... But who would maintain
that these two parties, i.e. the Pharisees and Sadducees,
constituted in reality the Jewish people at this period,
however much they may have been pushed into the foreground
of historical events? The Pharisees and Sadducees,
no less than the Essenes, who were far removed from the
sphere of politics, were only sects of the Jews. The Pharisees
formed, even on Josephus’ showing (<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XVII, ii. 4),
only a fraction of the people, and did not number much more
than six thousand all told; they were thus not much more
numerous than the Essenes with their four thousand (Philo,
<cite lang="la">Quod omn. prob.</cite>, II, 457; Josephus, <cite>Antiq.</cite>, XVIII, i. 5). And
if it be willingly granted that the Pharisees had many adherents
among the people, yet this was very far from being the
People itself.... And where remain then the great masses
of the ‘people of the land,’ the really deciding factor, who
were neither Pharisæan nor Sadducæan, but among whom
the Jewish spirit-of-the-people (<i lang="de">Volksgeist</i>), developed under
favourable conditions during the memorable days of the
Ptolemys, was not yet wholly extinguished and still possessed
sufficient power to protect itself against the yoke which
Pharisaism sought to put upon the people?”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary to assume that all the literature produced
by the Jews during these centuries emanated either
from Pharisaic or Sadducæan circles. There are other
alternatives; and in the present case it seems most probable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
that the bulk of this book was written by apocalyptists who
belonged neither to Pharisaic nor yet to Sadducæan circles.</p>

<p>The Book of Enoch was originally written partly in
Aramaic (vi.-xxxvi., lxxxiii.-xc., according to Charles) and
partly in Hebrew (the rest of the book). No portion of the
book in its original form has come down to us; the Ethiopic
version is the only complete one extant, it was translated
from the Greek version of which only fragments remain.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
The Latin version, which was also made from the Greek,
is not extant with the exception of i. 9, cvi. 1-18. That the
book is Palestinian is generally acknowledged; its original
language of itself points to this.</p>

<p>The Book of Enoch is in many respects the most important
of all the apocalypses, since it is without a rival for the
history of doctrinal development during the last two pre-Christian
centuries. The teaching of the book is sometimes
contradictory, which is not to be wondered at in view of its
composite authorship; for example, in lxix. 11 it is said that
man was originally created without sin, “like the angels,”
but that death came through sin and destroyed him;
but elsewhere the entering in of sin from the first is traced to
the spiritual world. The doctrines of angels and demons
appear in a developed form in this book. The teaching
concerning the Kingdom is likewise contradictory; vi.-xxxvi.
are full of materialistic ideas, whereas xci.-civ. are marked by
conceptions which are entirely spiritual. So, too, with
regard to the Messiah; at one time He is represented as
without having any special <i lang="fr">rôle</i> to fill, at another He appears
as the “Righteous One,” or as the “Elect One,” “The Son
of Man,” and “The Christ” or “Anointed One.” Regarding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the Last Things, the teaching about the Judgement varies according
as to whether the Messianic Kingdom is conceived of as
an eternal earthly kingdom, in which case the final Judgement
precedes it, or as only a temporary earthly kingdom, when the
Judgement takes place at its close; in xxxvii.-lxxi. (“The
Similitudes”) it is taught that the Messianic Kingdom is
eternal and embraces heaven and earth, here it is initiated by
the final Judgement. The punishment of the wicked takes
place in Sheol, part of which is a place of fire, and equivalent
to the later Gehenna conception; another part of Sheol is
described as an intermediate resting-place of the righteous.
In the oldest portions of the book both soul and body, a
physical body, rise and abide eternally in the earthly Messianic
Kingdom; in “The Similitudes” it is a spiritual body
which rises to a spiritual kingdom; while in the latest
section of the book it is taught that only the spirit rises, and
only the righteous attain to the resurrection.</p>

<p>Most of the New Testament writers have been influenced
by the book in thought and diction. “It is quoted as a
genuine production of Enoch by St. Jude (verses 14, 15), and
as Scripture by St. Barnabas. The authors of the Book of
Jubilees, the Apocalypse of Baruch, and 4 Ezra laid it
under contribution. With the earlier Fathers and Apologists
it had all the weight of a canonical book.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>This work consisted originally of fourteen books, twelve
of which have survived; but we are here concerned only
with the Proœmium and books iii.-v., the remainder belonging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
to later times. The Proœmium and books iii.-v. belong,
like the rest of the work, to different dates, but the bulk of
the Proœmium and book iii. belong to about the middle of
the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, books iv. and v. to the latter half of
the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> These portions are all Jewish in the
main, though interspersed with Christian elements.</p>

<p>Of authorship little can be said; the main portion of the
Proœmium and book iii. were probably written by a Jew of
Alexandria, parts of book iv. by a Palestinian Jew, and the
bulk of book v. also by a Jew of Alexandria. The Oracles
were, of course, all written in Greek, and they were put forth
in the interests of Jewish <em>propaganda</em>, of which mention
has already been made above. They were written in the
form of the ancient heathen oracles, in Greek hexameters.
The sibyl of heathen antiquity was a prophetess inspired by
the gods who prophesied about the fate of cities and kingdoms,
and gave counsel in times of stress and difficulty;
she dwelt, like a nymph, beside streams or in grottoes.
“Written records of supposed Sibylline oracles,” says
Schürer, “were here and there in circulation; but such
remains of them as have come down to us through occasional
quotations in authors such as Plutarch, Pausanias and others
are brief and scanty, and furnish no distinct notion of them.
In Asia Minor and Greece these pieces circulated only in
private possession, without being publicly supervised or
officially used; but their credit and influence must not
be on that account lightly estimated.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Book iii., which is
of most importance in the present connection, is full of
apocalyptic elements; it tells of the fate of the successive
kingdoms which are to bear rule over the Jews, and of the
judgements of God upon both Jews and Gentiles; the coming
of the Messianic king is prophesied, and the victory over
his adversaries described; an account of the prosperity and
blessedness of the Messianic Kingdom follows, to which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
added a recital of the signs which shall herald the end of all

<p>In book iv., as well as in book v., the apocalyptic element
is absent, with the one exception that in the latter there is a
prophecy of woe upon the idolatrous Gentiles, and of blessing
upon Israel (v. 260-285). The superiority of Judaism over
the heathen religions is, as one would expect in propagandist
literature of this kind, again and again insisted upon.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Charles says in reference to the authorship of
this book: “I have with some hesitation come to the conclusion
that the groundwork is the work of a single writer
of the Pharisaic school. He is an upholder of the Law and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the Temple sacrifices; he believes in the Messianic Kingdom
and the resurrection of the body to a new life therein. He
is, however, a Pharisee of the early type—that is a Chasid....
The groundwork, which consists of about eleven-twelfths
of the Testaments, after the removal of the Jewish
and Christian additions, presents, it must be confessed, a
want of coherence at times, and the parts dealing with the
duty of submission to Levi, or to Levi and Judah jointly,
come in occasionally very abruptly. Notwithstanding, the
present editor adheres to the idea of the unity of the book;
for the two phenomena referred to—the strictly Chasid
element in the book, and its loyal acceptance of the Maccabæan
dynasty—were exactly characteristic of the period to
which our author belongs, and to none other before or
after. Furthermore, both these parts of the book are alike
universalistic in tone.”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>We have seen above what the attitude of the Sadducees
was towards the written Law; so that a book wherein
loyalty to the Law and to the Temple sacrifices is upheld
does not necessarily point to Pharisaic authorship unless
it can be shown that by the Law is meant not merely the
Pentateuch, but also the Pharisaic conception of the Law;
and of this there are no indications in the book. The
Sadducees believed, moreover, in a Messianic Kingdom; but
the Messiah, according to them, was to be of priestly, not
of Davidic, descent; so that belief in the Messianic Kingdom
does not necessarily imply Pharisaic authorship of the book
in which it occurs unless the specifically Pharisaic conception
of the Messiah is put forth; but this also is not the case
in the book before us. Charles says: “In the original work
the Messiah is to be descended from Levi, and not from
Judah—in other words, he is to be first of all a priest, and
then a prophet and king. There are many passages expressing
this view”; these are enumerated; he then continues:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
“We have here the attestation of a most remarkable revolution
in the Jewish expectations of the Messiah. For some
thirty or forty years the hopes of a Messiah from Judah was
abandoned in favour of a Messiah from Levi. But with
the breach of Hyrcanus with the Pharisees this hope was
abandoned, and so we find that in the first century additions,
the hope of a Messiah from Judah reappears (T. Jud.,
xxiv. 5, 6; T. Naph., iv. 5 (?)).”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> An easier and more
natural explanation, however, is forthcoming if, as we believe,
the groundwork of this book is of Sadducæan authorship.
The loyal acceptance of the reigning dynasty is by no
means necessarily a proof of Pharisaic authorship, for the
Pharisees broke entirely with John Hyrcanus before the
end of his reign (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 104), while the Sadducees were loyal
to him in consequence.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The references to the resurrection
of the body would be fatal to Sadducæan authorship if it
could be proved that these are not later interpolations.
That a Pharisee has worked over the book is abundantly
evident. We conclude, therefore, that as in the groundwork
of the book the distinctive marks of Pharisaism are wanting,
and that as what marks there are, are those of a Sadducæan
character, the book in its original form was written by a
Sadducee for the purpose of making peace with the Pharisees;
for the peaceable tone of many parts of the book is one of its
characteristics; the virtue of unity among the descendants
of the Patriarchs is again and again insisted on. <em>Traits</em>
of a specifically Sadducæan character are well brought out
by Leszynsky.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> On the other hand, nothing could be more
un-Pharisaic than the spirit of the book so well described
by Charles: “A true son of the larger-hearted Old Testament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
prophets he proclaims the salvation of the Gentiles.
The promised time has come. The kingdom is already
established, and all the Gentiles will be saved through Israel.
In the Judgement the conduct of the best heathen will
form the norm according to which Israel will be judged.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The earliest form of the book as now in existence is
Greek; but this is a translation from a Hebrew original.
This is proved by the presence of numberless Hebrew
constructions and expressions throughout the book. In its
original form each of the “Testaments” seems to have
been modelled on the same pattern; in each case the patriarch
first gives an account of his life; this is based on the
Old Testament, but embellished with many new details.
In each autobiography the patriarch candidly confesses the
sins of which he has been guilty, though in some instances
he is able to boast of his virtues. In the next place, the
patriarch offers in each case an exhortation to his descendants;
this is based on the preceding autobiographical
sketch; warnings are uttered against falling into the sins
of which the narrator himself has been guilty; in the case of
his life having been a virtuous one it is held out as an example
for his descendants to follow. A third element in each of the
Testaments is a prediction regarding the future of the tribe
in question.</p>

<p>There are a number of later Christian interpolations and
additions in the book; but, generally speaking, these are of
so obvious a character that they may be discerned at once;
a good example is found in the Testament of Simeon vi. 7,
where these words are added: “Because God hath taken a
body and eaten with men, and saved men.” Or, again, in
the Testament of Levi xiv. 2, the original text runs: “For
our father Israel is pure from the transgressions of the chief
priests,” then the following Christian addition is made:
“Who shall lay their hands upon the Saviour of the world.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Similar additions, as well as interpolations, occur throughout
the book.</p>

<p>But the great importance of this book lies in its ethical
teaching, wherein it often reveals a spirit thoroughly akin
to that of the Gospels; it will be best to illustrate this by
giving two of the most notable examples. In the Testament
of Gad vi. 3-7 it is said: “Love ye, therefore, one
another from the heart; and if a man sin against thee,
cast forth the poison of hate and speak peaceably to him,
and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he confess and repent,
forgive him. But if he deny it, do not get into a
passion with him, lest catching the poison from thee he take
to swearing and so thou sin doubly.... But if he be shameless,
and perisheth in his wrong-doing, even so forgive him
from the heart, and leave to God the avenging” (with this
compare Matt. xviii. 15, Luke xvii. 3). The command to
love God and one’s neighbour finds expression in the Testament
of Gad v. 3: “Love the Lord through all your life,
and one another with a true heart” (cp. Matt. xxii. 37-39).
These and many other examples of a similar character are
all the more striking when it is seen how close the linguistic
parallels are (amounting frequently to verbal identity)
between the Greek text of our book and that of the Gospels.
While these and similar passages read like genuine parts of
the original work the <em>possibility</em> that they may be Christian
is not excluded.</p>

<p>The “Testaments” can scarcely be reckoned as belonging
to the Apocalyptic Literature proper, but there are apocalyptic
elements in the testaments of Levi and of Naphthali.</p>

<p>Although the eighteen psalms comprised in this book are
not apocalyptic in character, a brief mention of them here is
not out of place, for they offer us a true picture of the Pharisaic
standpoint, and are therefore useful for purposes of
comparison when seeking to decide the Pharisaic authorship,
or otherwise, of other books.</p>

<p>These psalms were originally written in Hebrew during the
middle of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; concerning these two points
there is a general consensus of opinion. Whether the hand
of one or more writers is to be discerned is an open question.
The mental background of these Psalms is one of sorrow
occasioned by the capture of Jerusalem by Pompey and his
desecration of the Temple. But this event is represented as
the just punishment of God, for instead of a Davidic king
the Hasmonæans were rulers, and they had assumed the
high-priestly office although they were not of high-priestly
descent. The ruling house was supported by the Sadducees;
it is this which causes the sorrow of the writer, or writers,
to be mixed with bitter resentment. These Psalms thus give
us a picture of the Pharisees and Sadducees, but from the
Pharisaic point of view; so that neither the portraiture of
Pharisaic piety nor yet that of Sadducæan wickedness must
be taken <i lang="fr">au pied de la lettre</i>. The general point of view of
the book has been well summed up by Buchanan Gray
thus: “It is the Pharisaic piety that breathes through the
Psalms; it is their opposition to the worldly, non-Davidic
monarchy, and to the illegitimate high-priesthood of the
ruling Hasmonæan king, Aristobulus, that finds expression
here; the Messianic hope (especially xvii. 23 ff.), the firm
belief in a future life which characterizes them later, and
renders them naturally political quietists and indifferent
to political schemes, are already conspicuous here. And,
again, the later attitude of the Pharisees in the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
free-will as described by Josephus (<cite>Bell. Jud.</cite>, II, viii. 14)—these
ascribe all to fate and to God, and yet allow that to
act as is right, or the contrary, is principally in the power of
men: although fate does co-operate in every action—is
almost exactly paralleled by two passages in the Psalms,
v. 4, ix. 6.”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

of Moses”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> (Syncellus), it is not an apocalyptic work in the
proper sense of the word. It purports, however, to have
been given through angels to Moses on Mount Sinai, and can,
therefore, in a certain sense be described as an apocalypse;
but it scarcely touches upon the themes which form the
main content of the apocalyptic works proper. It is also
called the “Little Genesis,” as it follows the narrative as
given in the Book of Genesis and Exodus i.-xii., but this is
divided into fixed periods of time, or “Jubilees,” hence its
name; for this word is directly derived from the Hebrew
term <em>Jobel</em> which, according to most modern scholars,
means “ram” or “ram’s horn”; the year of Jubilee thus
means literally “the year of ram’s horn”; the fiftieth year
was so called because it was proclaimed by the blowing of
rams’ horns (see Lev. xxv.). “As the author seeks to
reproduce the history of primitive times <em>in the spirit of his
own day</em>, he deals with the biblical text in a very free
fashion. Many things that did not happen to interest him,
or that he considered objectionable, were either omitted
or altered, while others were still further amplified by the
addition of numerous particulars of one kind or another”
(Schürer, <i>Op. cit.</i>, II, iii. p. 136).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>It is impossible to fix the exact date of the book with any
certainty, but that it belongs at the latest to the second
half of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> may be unhesitatingly stated.
That it was written by a Palestinian Pharisee is the opinion
of most scholars; it is true that it is strongly legalistic in
character, so much so that the Messianic Kingdom is conceived
of as the outcome of a gradual process which is bound
up with the study of the Law. The writer, moreover,
greatly extols the Sabbath, Circumcision, the dietary laws,
the laws of purification, etc.; its strongly marked spirit of
exclusiveness is also said to betray its Pharisaic origin.
But with the exception of the last point there is nothing in all
this which forbids us to believe in Sadducæan authorship
(see above, <a href="#PI_CHIV_b">Chapter IV, § ii. (<i>b</i>)</a>). Leszynsky seems to us to
have proved his contention that the author was a Sadducee,
who ascribed Mosaic authorship to the book for the purpose
of obtaining the needful authority for Sadducæan views
concerning the Law. The details of his argument would
take us too far afield; he discusses the question with much
learning on pp. 181-234 of his book.</p>

<p>That the book was originally written in Hebrew admits of
no doubt; no part of this has come down to us, however.
The Greek version, made from the Hebrew, exists only in
fragments found in the writings of some ancient authors.
The Ethiopic version, which was made from the Greek,
exists almost in its entirety; of the Latin version, also made
from the Greek, about one-fourth is extant. The importance
of the book, in the words of Charles, lies in the fact that it is
“not only indispensable to students of the New Testament,
and of the history of the Pharisaic movement: it is likewise
of first-class importance as a witness to the readings of the
Hebrew text of Genesis about the beginning of the Christian
era” (<cite>Encycl. Bibl.</cite>, I, 230). As we incline, however, to the
belief in its Sadducæan authorship, we regard it as important
for the history of the antagonism between the Pharisees and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Sadducees, and their respective teaching, rather than merely
for the history of the Pharisaic movement.</p>

<p>The numerous references in early Christian literature to
apocryphal books of Moses makes it clear that several well-known
books of the kind must once have been in existence.
The different titles of these books which are mentioned are a
little confusing; we have just seen that the “Apocalypse of
Moses” was one of the names given to the Book of Jubilees;
we shall see below (<a href="#PI_CHX_j">§ <i>j</i></a>) that an “Apocalypse of Moses”
is more or less parallel with the “Life of Adam and Eve.”
Mention is made of a “Book of secret words of Moses” and
of the “Assumption of Moses” in the commentary of
Gelasius Cyzicenus on the acts of the council of Nicæa;
Origen (<cite>De princip.</cite>, III, ii. 1) speaks of the book called the
“Ascension of Moses,” and Didymus, in writing on the epistle
of Jude, refers to the “Assumption of Moses”; and more
than once the “Testament of Moses” is mentioned. It is
probable that these two latter are both included in the book
we are considering, but that they were originally distinct
and of different authorship. The book as a whole was
written at the very beginning of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; this
is the opinion of most authorities, based upon fairly clear
indications in the book itself (see Charles in the <cite>Encycl. Bibl.</cite>,
I, 235). The author, according to Charles, “was a Pharisee,
and a Pharisee who was the antithesis of the Zealot exactly
in those respects in which Pharisaism differed from Zealotism.
His book was designed as a protection against the growing
secularization of the Pharisaic party through its adoption of
political ideals and popular Messianic beliefs”; elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Charles says<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>: “He was a Pharisee of a fast-disappearing
type, recalling in all respects the Chasid of the early Maccabæan
times, and upholding the old traditions of quietude
and resignation.” Leszynsky, on the other hand, is inclined
to believe that the author was a Sadducee; his arguments,
however, are not convincing.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The book contains what purports to be a prediction of
the future history of Israel which had been revealed to Moses,
and which he in turn reveals to Joshua. It is, therefore, as
a whole not an apocalyptic book in the technical sense,
though part of it does distinctly come under this designation;
this is clear from Chapter x., which is written in poetry, and
in the familiar apocalyptic strain; it tells of the coming of
divine rule upon earth, when sorrow shall be taken away,
and wrath shall come upon the enemies of God; the signs
of the end are graphically described.</p>

<p>The book was originally written in Hebrew, though some
scholars contend for an Aramaic original. Only part of the
book has so far been recovered and this is in Latin, which
was, however, made from a Greek translation of the original.</p>

</div>

<p>In ancient ecclesiastical writings mention is made of three
apocryphal books about Isaiah, viz. the “Ascension of
Isaiah,” the “Martyrdom of Isaiah,” and the “Vision of
Isaiah.” It is possible that the “Ascension” is only another
name for the “Vision,” for in Chapter x., which belongs
to the “Vision” portion, an account is given of Isaiah
ascending to the seventh heaven. But, in any case, two
writings are incorporated in the book. Moreover, there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
many additions made by a Christian editor. These various
elements belong to different dates; the earliest is the
“Martyrdom,” which comprises ii. i-iii. 12, v. 2-14; this
is of Jewish authorship, and belongs to the first half of
the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the final words of this portion have a
special interest inasmuch as the reference to the sawing
asunder of Isaiah there mentioned points to this being the
authority for the statement in Hebrews xi. 37. The words
are as follows: “But Isaiah neither cried aloud nor wept
whilst he was being sawn asunder, for his mouth spoke with
the Holy Ghost until he had been sawn asunder.” Next
in date is a short apocalypse (iii. 13-v. 1); this gives a
<i lang="fr">résumé</i> of the early history of the Christian Church, and foretells
the last judgement; this is by a Christian author, and
belongs to about the middle of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, or a
little later. Lastly, there is the “Vision” (vi.-xi.), which is
likewise Christian, and belongs to the end of the first century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> The first chapter is probably an addition by a Christian
editor, the date of which cannot be fixed. The whole of this
material has come down to us in an Ethiopic version; this
was made from the original Greek, only fragments of which
have survived; a Latin version which was made from the
Greek existed at one time, but here again only fragments
have come down to us.</p>

</div>

<p>This Apocalypse, called also the “Slavonic Enoch” on
account of the language in which it has survived, has nothing
to do with the “Ethiopic Book of Enoch” already dealt
with, excepting that it sometimes reproduces the phraseology
and conceptions of the latter. Some sections, the exact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
extent of which it is impossible to define (Charles), have a
Hebrew background and were originally written in this
language; these are, at latest, pre-Christian; but the main
part of the book was written in Greek, and belongs to about
the middle of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, at any rate to some period
prior to the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70, for in lix. 2 the sacrificial system
is referred to which presupposes the existence of the Temple
(“For a man offers clean animals and makes his sacrifice
that he may preserve his soul. And if he offer as a sacrifice
from clean beasts and birds, he preserves his soul”). There
are numberless indications in the book to prove that the
author was a Jew, but of the Hellenistic type, for in questions
affecting the origin of the earth, sin, death, etc., he adopts
Platonic, Egyptian and Zend elements into his system
(Charles) in a way which would have been impossible to a
Palestinian Jew; he is, however, so far orthodox in that he
upholds the sacrificial system, as we have seen, and believes
in the Law and in the life eternal. It is interesting to note
that the writer frequently quotes passages from Ecclesiasticus
in its Greek form, and was also evidently conversant
with the Book of Wisdom.</p>

<p>There is one point of especial interest in this book to
which a brief reference may be made. We meet here for
the first time with the Jewish conception of the Millennium;
the <em>rationale</em> of its origin is thus given by Charles: “The
account in Genesis of the first week of creation came in pre-Christian
times to be regarded not only as a history of the
past, but as a forecast of the future history of the world so
created. Thus as the world was created in six days, so its
history was to be accomplished in 6,000 years; for 1,000
years are with God as one day (cp. Ps. xc. 4; 2 Peter iii. 8),
and as God rested on the seventh day, so at the close of the
6,000 years there would be a rest of 1,000 years, i.e. the millennium.”
It is also worth adding that the doctrine of the
seven heavens is treated in this book with a fulness and clearness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
not found elsewhere; for an illuminating discussion
on the subject see Morfill and Charles’ edition of the book,

</div>

<p>This Baruch apocalypse is called the Syriac one because
this is the language in which it has come down to us; it is
to be distinguished from the “Greek Apocalypse of Baruch”
§ (<i>k</i>), which is an entirely different work. In its present form
it is composite in character, but all its component parts may
be assigned to the period <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 50-100. To disentangle the
various elements contained in the book from one another
is a very difficult task; we follow Dr. Charles in giving the
following details. The authors are all Pharisees; some lived
before, and some after the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70;
the portions written before this date consist of an Apocalypse
(xxvii.-xxx. 1), and two Visions (xxxvi.-xl. and liii.-lxxiv,);
these chapters are important for the Messianic teaching
contained in them. The portions written after the year
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70 include the rest of the book, with the exception of
a few chapters added by a final editor. The present Syriac
book is a translation from a Greek version of the original
Hebrew.</p>

<p>This apocalypse is one of the most important books we
possess for the study of Judaism at the beginning of the
Christian era; all the vital doctrines come in for consideration—the
doctrine of God, of the Law, of the Messiah, Original
Sin and Free-will, Works and Justification, Forgiveness, and
the Resurrection.</p>

Hebrew; the latter exists now only in a Latin form, while
the Apocalypse is extant in Greek and Armenian. How the
book came to have the name of Moses in the title is difficult
to say; he is not mentioned in the book, which is strictly
a legendary life of Adam and Eve. For the study of the

<h4 id="PI_CHXI_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Wisdom Literature</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The Wisdom Literature of the Jews which has come
down to us comprises both canonical and uncanonical
books<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>; but the distinction may be ignored, for all the
books which belong to this Literature, though each has its
particular characteristics, are clearly members of one
family; they are all alike in possessing one outstanding
and typical mark of differentiation from the rest of the
Old Testament books, viz., in them religion has become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
philosophy. It was not, of course, philosophy in the Greek,
any more than in the modern, sense of the word; “the wise
men of Israel never approached their inquiries without
theological presuppositions; they had no desire to investigate
final causes; they started from a fundamental axiom,
‘In the beginning was God ...’; this postulate indicates
the character of their studies, which were not so much
speculative as practical: their desire was not so much to
understand the works of God, as to acquaint themselves
with their harmonies, beauties, and adaptations, and all
this with the final object of knowing and doing the will of
God.”<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> But while the fundamental Jewish monotheistic
belief is taken for granted throughout the Wisdom Literature,
the latter has other characteristics which are not wholly
in accord with traditional Judaism. That the various writers
differ in their teaching from each other, and that the same
writer is not always consistent in his teaching, is not a cause
for surprise; these men had entered upon new ways of
thinking, and were grappling with new subjects of thought;
it was natural that their speculations should sometimes be
only tentative; they had, moreover, come into contact with
new influences which would have affected one more than
another. It must also be remembered that some of the
books belonging to this literature, notably Proverbs and
Job, are of composite authorship, and that possibly the
component parts belong to different periods; so that what
may sometimes appear contradictory in one writing in
reality represents some development of thought belonging
to a later writer. But however this may be, we certainly
find in the Wisdom Literature positions taken up which
show to some extent a departure from traditional Judaism.
The wise men present a very interesting combination in
that they are at once universalistic and conservative. We
find in the Wisdom Literature but little stress laid on national<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
institutions and laws, such, for example, as the sacrificial
system; it is recognized, it is true, but rather because it
is thought right to keep up the old customs than that there
is any intrinsic value or permanent necessity in the system.
In like manner the Messianic expectations receive very
scanty recognition. The attitude of the sages towards the
Gentiles is generally friendly; they recognized the higher
culture, in many respects, of these nations, and were therefore
willing to learn from them; not infrequently we find,
for example, that the God of the Jews is declared to be the
God of all men. But the most striking characteristic,
which is quite un-Jewish, is the conception of the God-like
<em>Sophia</em>, which is conceived of as a creative divine power
existing before the creation of the world; “this hypostatization
of Wisdom,” says Friedländer, “is here a downright
sacrilege; it betrays the violent entry of an alien spirit
into the domain of Judaism, and even the fine way in which
the essence of the divine Wisdom is described cannot for a
moment blind us to the act of violence perpetrated by the
forcible intrusion of Greek conceptions into the atmosphere
of the old Hebrew idea of Wisdom.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> But as we deal in
section III of this chapter with the conception of Wisdom
as portrayed in all the books of the Wisdom Literature, it
will not be necessary to say anything on this subject here.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHXI_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Origin of the Hebrew Conception of Wisdom</span></h4>

<p>There is a great difference between the conception of
Wisdom which is presented in the literature of Israel prior
to the captivity and that which meets us in the Wisdom
Literature proper; yet there is no sort of doubt that the
latter represents the full growth of a plant whose seed can
be clearly seen in the early writings of the Old Testament.
This is, however, only part of the truth; for while it is true
to say that the religious-intellectual <em>spirit</em> to which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Wisdom Literature of the Jews owed its existence was of
indigenous growth, it is no less true to say that the elements
which contributed to the production of that Literature
were not exclusively Jewish. We shall try to show presently
that Babylonian influence was, in part, at work in helping
the sages of Israel both before the captivity, as well as in
post-exilic times, to frame their ideas on Wisdom as these
appear in the Wisdom Literature, while still later the
influence of the Greek spirit is to be clearly discerned. But
our first task must be to seek the first beginnings of Wisdom
in the earlier books of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>When precisely ideas about Wisdom began to manifest
themselves in Israel it would be impossible to say, but the
germs from which, centuries after, the Wisdom Literature
grew were already in existence during the early days of the
Monarchy, for the tradition of Solomon’s wisdom is undoubtedly
based upon fact. In 1 Kings iv. 30-34 (verses
10-14 in the Hebrew) it is said: “And Solomon’s wisdom
excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all
the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men....
And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were
a thousand and five. And he spake of trees.... And
there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
from all the kings of the earth, which had heard of his
wisdom.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Even allowing for some exaggeration, which is
so natural to an oriental writer, there can be little doubt
that this passage is based upon actual fact, though what
is meant by Wisdom in this and similar passages was very
different from what would now be understood by that term,
as we shall see. But Solomon was not the first example of
a “wise man” in Israel. The earliest form of Wisdom is
represented by what the Hebrews called a <em>māshāl</em>; this is
usually translated by “proverb,” but it has, in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
this, a much wider signification, for it is used of a prophetic
figurative discourse, such as those uttered by Balaam; in
later times it was also used to describe a parable and an
allegory; in this sense it occurs in Ezekiel. In its earlier
simple sense a <em>māshāl</em> meant a “proverb,” not necessarily
of a religious, or even ethical, content; it expressed some
general truth brought home to men by the observance of
the ordinary experiences of life. One of the very simplest
of these found in the Old Testament is: “Out of the wicked
cometh forth wickedness” (1 Sam. xxiv. 13); this is said
to be “a proverb of the ancients,” which shows that it
must have long been in use among the Israelites. In 2
Samuel xx. 18 another proverb, which seems likewise to
have been long current among the people, is preserved:
“They were wont to speak in old time, saying, ‘They shall
surely ask counsel at Abel’”; this was uttered by a “wise
woman.” With deeper observation and reflection more
subtle thoughts came to be expressed in this form. “The
Israelites, like all other peoples, must have reflected more
or less, from the moment when they attained a settled
civilization, on general questions of life. The lowest form
of such reflection appears in popular proverbs and fables,
which express, usually in a one-sided and superficial way,
the result of the ordinary common-sense experience and
observation.”<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> As a general rule, however, the few examples
of proverbs which we find in the earlier books of
the Old Testament reflect a relatively somewhat advanced
type, and what is especially interesting about them is that
they appear not infrequently to have been made on the spur
of the moment; this is the case with the proverb in 1 Samuel
x. 12: “Is Saul among the prophets?” which is said to
have “become a proverb.” Another saying the form and
rhythm of which marks it out as a proverb is: “The blind
and the lame shall not come into the house” (2 Sam. v. 8,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
R.V. marg.); the fact that this is prefaced by the words,
“Wherefore they say,” also points to its having been a
popular proverb. These, and similar proverbs, though
originally composed in reference to some particular occurrence,
became applicable in course of time in a more general
way. The proverb, for example, “Is Saul among the prophets?”
might be described as the <em>converse</em> of the modern
proverb: “Birds of a feather flock together”; or, again,
the proverb: “They shall surely ask counsel at Abel,” may
well have become a popular way of expressing the truth
that if you want guidance you must seek it at the right
quarter. A later and more advanced type of proverb is
uttered by the prophet Hosea (viii. 7): “They sow the wind,
and they shall reap the whirlwind”; another is quoted in
Jeremiah xxxi. 29 and Ezekiel xviii. 2 in the words:
“The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth
are set on edge.”</p>

<p>The simplest form of proverb was thus the earliest type
of “Wisdom” among the Israelites, as it was among other
peoples. But the content of a proverb easily lent itself, in
the minds of the more reflective, to expansion, and thus by
degrees were formed fables and parables whereby truths
were illustrated and brought home to the minds of men.
One of the earliest fables—the exact application of which in
its present context is not quite easy to determine—is preserved
in Judges ix. 8-15:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Once upon a time the trees went forth to anoint over them a king;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they said to the olive: “Rule thou over us.” And the olive said to them:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Should I give up my fatness wherewith they honour gods and men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And go and wave over the trees!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then said the trees to the fig-tree: “Come thou, be king over us.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the fig-tree said to them:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Should I give up my sweetness and my good fruit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And go and wave over the trees!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then said the trees to the vine: “Come thou, be king over us.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the vine said unto them:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Should I give up my wine that cheereth gods and men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And go and wave over the trees!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then said all the trees to the thorn-bush: “Come thou, be king over us.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the thorn-bush said to the trees:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“If truly ye anoint me as king over you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then come, trust to my shadow; but if not, then may fire come forth from the thorn-bush,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And devour the cedars of Lebanon!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have attempted to translate this in the poetical form
of the original Hebrew; it will be seen that the thought-structure
is very simple, so that the ideas conveyed would
be easily apprehended by the common people to which the
fable was addressed. Another fable, the only other one
preserved in the Old Testament, occurs in 2 Kings xiv. 9:
“The bramble that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give thy daughter to my son to
wife’; and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon
and trod down the bramble.” But it is in the early Old
Testament <em>parables</em> that the highest form of “Wisdom”
in pre-exilic Israel is reached. As in the case of fables, only
two parables are preserved; they differ from fables in two
important particulars: in that only men are represented as
taking part and speaking, and that the content of a parable,
so far as we are able to judge from the specimens preserved,
is <em>religious</em>; this is a large step forward in approximation
to the later Jewish conception of Wisdom. The earliest
Old Testament parable occurs in 2 Samuel xii. 1-4, Nathan’s
parable of the ewe-lamb; it is sufficiently well known, and
need not be quoted. The other is Isaiah’s parable of the
vineyard in Isaiah v. 1-4, which is written in poetry, while
the former is in prose. We may add here one other
form of Wisdom, found mainly in Ezekiel, namely the
<em>allegory</em>; this is also called a <em>māshāl</em>, but this word is here
used in an extended sense, for the allegory, though a parable
in form, presents a symbolical picture the meaning of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
is not, like the parable, easily grasped, but demands some
thought before it can be properly understood; it is therefore
sometimes called a “riddle.” It differs in another respect
from the parable, for symbols take the place of persons;
but, like the parable, the Old Testament allegory has a
religious signification. Among the most striking allegories
are: the allegory of the great eagles (Ezek. xvii. 3-8), the
allegory of the caldron (Ezek. xxiv. 3-5), and the allegory
of the valley full of dry bones (Ezek. xxxvii. 1-10); but
there are a considerable number of others.</p>

<p>The examples of “Wisdom” which have so far been given
form an important element in the antecedents of the Wisdom
literature; but that this element was not exclusively
Israelite is implied in the Old Testament itself, for in a
passage already quoted (1 Kings iv. 30, [verse 10 in Hebrew])
it is said: “And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of
all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.”
As in so many other respects, so, too, in the domain of
Wisdom, Babylon and Egypt evidently exercised considerable
influence over the Israelites<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>; and if this was so in
pre-exilic times, much more will it have been the case—at
any rate as far as Babylon was concerned—when a large
portion, especially of the cultured classes, of the nation was
brought into immediate contact with Babylonian thought
during the exile. The following may be given as an example
of the way in which the Babylonian conception of
Wisdom influenced the Jews. According to the Babylonian
cosmology, Wisdom dwelt in the depths of the sea with Ea,
the creative deity. Apsu, “the deep,” is called “the house
of Wisdom” because out of it came forth the Wisdom of Ea,
and the word of Ea; one of the epithets applied to the god
Ea is “lord of Wisdom.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> This conception of the “deep”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
being the home of Wisdom is reflected in the Wisdom Literature
of the Jews; in Psalms xxxvi. 6 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy judgements are a great deep,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the original is more forcible, for literally it runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy judgements are Tehom Rabbah,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which is the ancient proper name for the ocean. So, too, in
Ecclesiasticus xxiv. 5, Wisdom says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alone I compassed the circuit of heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And in the depth of the abyss I walked.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Moreover, the fundamental conception of Wisdom in the
Wisdom Literature (of which we shall speak presently) is its
inseparable connection with God; the deeper insight of the
Jewish sages saw some truth in the Babylonian conception
of the origin of Wisdom, that it dwelt in the depth of the sea
with the “Lord of Wisdom,” i.e. was in close touch with
the creative deity, so they adopted the conception and placed
it in a truer perspective.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> What Kohler<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> says in a somewhat
different connection is applicable here: “As soon as monotheism
was firmly established as a result of the labours of the
prophets, the wisdom of the east could be consulted by
Israel’s sages, and questions concerning the origin of all
things could be answered, in both poetry and prose, far
more intelligently than had been possible for the ancient
Babylonians.”</p>

<p>The origin of Wisdom is thus to be sought partly in Israel
itself, and partly in certain ideas which were adopted from
extraneous sources. But the way in which the Jewish sages
of post-exilic times developed both the indigenous as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the foreign elements is extremely instructive; to this we
must now devote some attention.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHXI_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Jewish Conception of Wisdom</span></h4>

<p>Our chief concern is the conception of Wisdom as portrayed
in the Wisdom Literature; but it will be well to say
just a word as to how Wisdom was conceived of in the earlier
literature, if only to show the immense development of
thought on the subject which took place after the Exile.
Wisdom (in Hebrew, <em>Chokmah</em>), and wise men (in Hebrew,
<em>Chakāmîm</em>) are fairly frequently mentioned in the Pentateuch,
and in the prophetical as well as in the historical
books; the words connote in general skill in doing anything,
whether in reference to artisans, or goldsmiths, or sailors,
or mourning women, or of the shrewdness of the astrologer
or the magician. In a higher sense it is used of wisdom in the
administration of affairs; in a few instances, as in Hosea xiv.
10, a man is called wise who is far-seeing in religious things
(cp. also Deut. iv. 6, Isa. xi. 2). That the prophets rarely
refer to the subject of Wisdom is natural enough; it was
not their function; they were called forth to rebuke and
exhort in the words and after the manner of preachers;
they appealed rather to the heart, to the emotions, to the
conscience, than to the intellect. Sometimes, it is true, we
find that “wise men” are spoken of as a class; thus Jeremiah
witnesses to the fact that already in his day the <em>Chakam</em>
(“wise man”) occupied a recognized position side by side
with the priest and the prophet: “For the law shall not
perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the
word from the prophet” (Jer. xviii. 18).</p>

<p>Turning now to consider the various conceptions of
Wisdom as portrayed in the Wisdom Literature, we may begin
with the well-known words: “The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of Wisdom.” This saying was to the Jewish
sages probably the most important of any that was uttered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
on the subject; it occurs in Job xxviii. 28 in the form:
“Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.” In its
more familiar form it appears in Psalms cxi. 6, Proverbs i. 7,
ix. 10 (cp. xv. 33), Ecclesiasticus i. 14 (cp. i. 15, 20, 27),
and the sense of the words occurs very often besides. But
it is worth pointing out that the meaning of the phrase is
not that the fear of the Lord is the commencement of Wisdom,
but rather the “end” of it; it is true that the Hebrew
word used, <em>rôsh</em> (lit. “head”), has also the sense of “beginning”;
but here it is “zenith” that is meant; the highest
and most perfect form of Wisdom is the fear of the Lord;
so that one might quite correctly render: “The fear of the
Lord is the end of Wisdom.”</p>

<p>In the Wisdom Literature generally Wisdom is never
used in the sense of pure knowledge; in its earliest meaning
it connoted the faculty of distinguishing between what
was useful or beneficent, and what was harmful; later, more
ethically, between what was good and what was bad. In
the Wisdom Literature there is always at bottom a <em>religious</em>
content in Wisdom; that is to say, it is a divinely bestowed
gift the possession of which makes man in some
measure like God. To be able to distinguish truly between
good and evil is the means whereby man is enabled to stand
in close relationship with God. But since the faculty to
distinguish between good and evil is a divine endowment,
every form of Wisdom comes from God, so that although the
knowledge and fear of the Lord is the highest type of Wisdom,
there are less exalted forms of it which are also regarded
as part of the one great gift of God; that is to say, what is
called worldly wisdom does not differ in kind, but only in
degree from the higher form. In Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus,
which belong closely together, and which are the chief
exponents of this worldly wisdom, moral precepts form the
main topics; and though widely different from divine
Wisdom, both emanate from the same source, and are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
ultimately to be traced back to the Giver of all good things.</p>

<p>But the particular conception of Wisdom which is of far-reaching
importance is that of personification which is
attributed to it in the Wisdom Literature. As a general
rule Wisdom is spoken of as something abstract; but in
some very striking passages it is personified. Before proceeding
to illustrate this it is necessary to utter a note of
warning against exaggeration in two opposite directions;
on the one hand, we are not justified in reading into the
words which speak of the personification of Wisdom a
meaning which they were not intended to bear; still less,
on the other hand, are we justified in explaining away altogether
the meaning which those words <em>were</em> intended to bear.
When, nowadays, we speak of things, whether abstract or
concrete, as personalities the words are used metaphorically
without the remotest intention of really imputing personality
to the things described; but we must guard against
the danger of assuming that our modern way of envisaging
things can be paralleled by that of two thousand years ago;
the <em>mode of expression</em> may not have greatly changed, but
the <em>way of conceiving</em> is totally different. When, among
the Jewish sages of old, Wisdom was personified, it was
conceived of, according to a modern writer on the subject,
as a “projection out of the Divine mind, as something more
than an attribute, but as something less than a hypostasis;
‘a little more than kin, and less than kind.’”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> This is
true as far as it goes; but the words of the Jewish sages,
as we shall see, lead one to believe that in their conception
of Wisdom they went even further than this; one may go
so far as to say that Wisdom was thought of as an intermediate
being between God and the world, a personality
existing alongside of God, but separate from Him. This is
more or less parallel to some other personifications, or quasi-personifications,
of certain attributes proper to God which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
appear in early post-Christian Jewish writings; these
occupy an intermediate position between personalities and
abstract beings. While, on the one hand, they are represented
as being so closely connected with God as to appear
as parts of Him, or attributes, they are, on the other hand,
so often spoken of as undertaking individual action that they
must be regarded in a real sense as separate from Him.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>The special importance of this conception of the hypostasis
of Wisdom lies not only in the fact that it forms the link
between the Palestinian and Hellenistic development of
Judaism, but also that it represents the contribution made
by the Wisdom Literature to the Christology of the Old
Testament, and has, moreover, greatly influenced Christian
theology.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>What has been said must now be illustrated from the
books of the Wisdom Literature.</p>

<p>In the earlier portions of Proverbs, Wisdom is always
an abstract thing; the only passage in which one might
conceivably discern a tendency to something different
would be xxii. 24:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but it is doubtful whether this means more than that when
a man has sought Wisdom and has found it, Wisdom may
be said to be “before his face,” i.e., it is the man who has
understanding before whose face (mental vision) Wisdom
appears, because he has sought her. It is in what is pretty
generally regarded as the latest portion of the book (viz.
i.-ix., belonging to the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> <i lang="la">circa</i>) that a real
personification of Wisdom is found; the whole of chapter
viii. is a speech uttered by Wisdom; much of it is undoubtedly
figurative, but the section viii. 22-31 evidently represents
something more than figurative language; it is too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
long to give in full, but a few of the verses must be given in
order to illustrate what has been said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Before his works of old.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or ever the earth was.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When there were no depths, I was brought forth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When there were no fountains abounding with water....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he established the heavens I was there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When he set a circle upon the face of the deep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he made firm the skies above;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When the fountains of the deep became strong;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he gave to the sea its bound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That the waters <ins class="corr" id="tn-237" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'should not trangress'">
should not transgress</ins> his commandment;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he marked out the foundations of the earth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Then was I by him, as a master workman....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the thought of Wisdom being utilized by God in
creating the world (“Then was I by him, as a master workman”),
one must compare the thought of God having created
the world by means of His <em>Word</em>; this thought is already
adumbrated in such a passage as Psalms xxxiii. 6: “By
the Word of the Lord were the heavens made”<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>; these
words were, at any rate, interpreted in later times to mean
that the whole of the Creation, as described in Genesis i.,
was accomplished by means of the Word of God, “Word,”
or <em>Memra</em>, having become, in the meantime, a quasi-personality
like Wisdom. This development may be seen at
work in the Wisdom Literature; for example, in Ecclesiasticus
xlii. 15 it is said: “By the Word of God (are) His
works,” i.e. were His works created; the context shows that it
is the works of the Creation which are referred to. In Wisdom
iv. 1 we have the same thought: “O God of my fathers,
and Lord of mercy, Who hast made all things by Thy Word,
and by Thy wisdom didst form man ...”; and, much later,
in 2 (4) Esdras vi. 38, it is said again: “Thy Word was (i.e.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
made) a perfect work,” where the reference is to the first day
of Creation. We are here irresistibly led to think of the opening
words of the fourth Gospel: “In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
made by Him; and without Him was not anything made
that hath been made” (John i. 1-3). It is very striking to
notice here how Christian truth was adumbrated in pre-Christian
times.</p>

<p>In the Book of Job, as everywhere in the Wisdom Literature,
Wisdom is of divine origin, e.g. xi. 5, 6:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But oh that God would speak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And open His lips against thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that He would show thee the secrets of Wisdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For sound wisdom is manifold (cp. xv. 8).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a general rule the wisdom spoken of in this book is
that of experience; but in one striking passage there is a
definite personification of Wisdom, viz. xxviii. 12-28; it
begins with the question: “Where shall Wisdom be found?”
And after its priceless value has been described, the writer
continues (verses 23 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">God understandeth the way thereof,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He knoweth the place thereof ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When He made a decree for the rain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a way for the lightning of the thunder:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then did He see it, and declare it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He established it, yea, and searched it out....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in this book where problems of great perplexity are
treated, there is less scope than in the other Wisdom books
for dealing specifically with Wisdom.</p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200) Wisdom, as one would naturally
expect, is always something abstract; but in this book,
with its terribly pessimistic tone, we come across a phenomenon
which is found nowhere else in the Wisdom literature;
the Preacher’s pessimism is seen to affect even his estimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
of Wisdom; what, for example, could be more dismal than
this?</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom
concerning all that is done under heaven; it is a sore travail that
God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith....
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me
great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my
heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. And
I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly;
I perceived that this also was a striving after wind. For in much
wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth
grief (i. 13-18).</p>
</div>

<p>This forlorn writer, furthermore, seems sometimes to approach
the subject in an entirely perverse spirit; he says
later:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness;
and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all. Then
said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen
even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my
heart, that this also was vanity. For of the wise man, even as of
the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the
days to come all will have been already forgotten. And how doth
the wise man die even as the fool (ii. 13-16).</p>
</div>

<p>This same spirit is manifested in the little parable in ix.
13-16:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>... There was a little city, and few men within it; and there
came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks
against it. Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he
by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that
same poor man. Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength;
nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are
not heard.</p>
</div>

<p>We can only say that such an attitude is deplorable; the
writer seems to think that unless Wisdom is recognized and
the wise man rewarded, it is vanity! That is quite different
from the usual attitude of the authors of the Wisdom Literature,
who esteem and love Wisdom for its own sake. There
are, it is true, a few passages in this book which witness to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
a better appreciation of Wisdom; for example, in vii. 11, 12
it is said:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it
for them that see the sun. For Wisdom is a defence, even as money
is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is that Wisdom preserveth
the life of him that hath it.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or again in viii. 1:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of
his face is changed.</p>
</div>

<p>So that, in spite of what he says elsewhere, the Preacher has
an innate liking for Wisdom; as a recent commentator on
the book says, “he admires it, and at times follows it
(i. 13, vii. 25, ix. 16); but, on the other hand, he cannot
rid himself of the feeling that the wise man toils in vain
(ix. 16), that his labour is a fruitless endeavour, and that
a child born dead is in reality happier than the wise man
(vi. 3-8). It is true that in another mood he declares that
it is better to know that one will die than to know nothing
(ix. 5); but, on the whole, his verdict is that Wisdom, like
all other things mundane, is vanity. The wise man has no
real advantage, except that he suffers with his eyes open;
in the end he dies like a fool, and goes to the same place
(ix. 1 ff.).”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>In the Wisdom of Ben-Sira (Ecclesiasticus) all that is
taught concerning Wisdom in the earlier books (with the
exception of what is peculiar to Ecclesiastes) finds full
expression, though Ben-Sira is not a slavish imitator; he
has his own ideas, and amplifies the earlier teaching, always
making it his own before giving expression to it. The divine
origin of Wisdom is shown by teaching that it is a direct
emanation from God:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">All Wisdom cometh from the Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And is with Him for ever (i. 1).</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I came forth from the mouth of the Most High,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And as a mist I covered the earth (xxiv. 3).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The existence of Wisdom before the creation of world is
definitely stated in the words:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Before them all (i.e. the heavens and the earth) was Wisdom
created (i. 4).</p>

<p>He created me from the beginning, before the world (xxiv. 9).</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is especially characteristic of Ben-Sira’s teaching that he
identifies the Law with Wisdom; this identification is
often taken for granted, while in several passages it is categorically
set forth. “Ben-Sira inculcates the truth that the
way to lead a wise life is to live according to the divine commandments,
and acting accordingly, man makes his human
wisdom approximate to the divine, and worldly, practical
wisdom, in its many and various forms, is thus of the same
kind, only less in degree, as divine wisdom. It is thus easy
to see that the identification between the Law and Wisdom
was inevitable.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> This identification is to be seen in such
passages as the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For he that feareth the Lord doeth this (i.e. seeketh Wisdom),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he that taketh hold of the Law findeth her (xv. 1).</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He that keepeth the Law controlleth his natural tendency,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the fear of the Lord is the consummation of Wisdom (xxi. 11).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The most direct assertion, however, of this identity between
the Law and Wisdom is found in xxiv. 23, 25:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">All these things (i.e. the things concerning Wisdom) are in the book of the covenant of God Most High,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Law which Moses commanded as an heritage for the assemblies of Jacob,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which filleth men with Wisdom, like Pison,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And like Tigris in the days of new fruits....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again in xix. 20:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">All Wisdom is the fear of the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all Wisdom is the fulfilling of the Law.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Although Wisdom is the free gift of God,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Without measure doth He grant her to them that love Him (i. 26),</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet man is not able to utilize it without earnest effort; he
has an irksome discipline to go through which will test his
sincerity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But I will walk with him in disguise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And at first I will try him with temptations.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear and dread will I bring upon him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I will torment him with chastisements (iv. 17);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but to the persevering the reward is great; this Ben-Sira
expresses in a passage full of poetical beauty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For at length thou wilt find her rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And she shall be turned for thee into gladness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And her fetters shall become a stay of strength for thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And her bands for robes of glory.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An ornament of gold is her yoke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And her fetters a cord of blue.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shalt array thee with her as with robes of glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And crown thee with her as with a crown of beauty (vi. 28-31).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It will have been noticed that in several of the passages
just quoted the personification of Wisdom is graphically
expressed; there are many others in this book in which this
is taught<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>; an interesting one is i. 15, where Wisdom is
described in taking up her abode among men:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">With faithful men is she, and she hath been established from eternity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And with their seed shall she continue.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In another passage Wisdom invites men to come and abide
with her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come unto me, ye that desire me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And be ye filled with my produce;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my memorial is sweeter than honey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the possession of me than the honey-comb (xxiv. 19, 20).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">This thought of Wisdom abiding among men is illustrated
in another way; Ben-Sira, in desiring to show the superiority
of the wisdom of Israel over that of the Greeks, represents
Wisdom as having sought a resting-place among the nations
of the world, but found that none were worthy of her;
thereupon God commanded her to abide in Israel where she
would find a permanent home:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">With all these (i.e. every people and nation) I sought a resting-place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And said: “In whose inheritance shall I lodge?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the Creator of all things gave me commandment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He that created me fixed my dwelling-place for me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And He said: “Let thy dwelling-place be in Jacob,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And in Israel take up thine inheritance....”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I took root among an honoured people,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the portion of the Lord and of His inheritance (xxiv. 7-12).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In his teaching concerning the personification of Wisdom
Ben-Sira offers something that is of a transitional character;
in the main, he bases his teaching on Proverbs, though he
shows some advance upon this; but he falls far behind
what the Book of Wisdom has to say on the subject. To
this we must now devote some attention.</p>

<p>The writer of the Book of Wisdom, like the writers of
all the books belonging to this literature, teaches the
divine origin of Wisdom; but he has his own way of expressing
this truth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For she is a breath of the power of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a clear effluence of the glory of the Almighty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore can nothing defiled find entrance into her.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For she is an effulgence from everlasting light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And an unspotted mirror of the working of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And an image of His goodness (vii. 25, 26).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This divine Wisdom is so indispensable to man that he is
of no account without it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">For even if a man be perfect among the sons of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet if the Wisdom that cometh from Thee be not with him, he shall be held in no account (ix. 6).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another invariable doctrine in the Wisdom books, namely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the existence of Wisdom before the world was created, and
her part in the Creation, is taught thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And with Thee is Wisdom, which knoweth Thy works,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And was present when Thou wast making the world (ix. 9).</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">For she is initiated into the knowledge of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And she chooseth out for Him His works (viii. 4).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ben-Sira, as we saw, identifies the Law with Wisdom; the
Jewish-Hellenistic writer of the Book of Wisdom does not
do so, but he teaches an identification between the Holy
Spirit of the Lord and Wisdom<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>; this is clear from the
following passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because Wisdom will not enter into a soul that deviseth evil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor dwell in a body that is held in pledge by sin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For Wisdom is a spirit that loveth man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she will not hold a blasphemer guiltless for his lips ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because the spirit of the Lord hath filled the world (i. 4-7).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Still more pointed are the words in ix. 17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And who ever gained knowledge of Thy counsel, except Thou gavest Wisdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And sentest Thy Holy Spirit from on high?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Further, Wisdom is identified with the Word of the Lord;
the “Word” is, however, used in the Old Testament sense,
not in that of the Philonian Logos. The Word, like Wisdom,
takes part in the Creation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O God of the fathers, and Lord Who keepest Thy mercy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who madest all things by Thy Word;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by Thy Wisdom Thou formedst man.... (ix. 1, 2).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Just as Wisdom sits upon the throne of God:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me Wisdom, her that sitteth by Thee on Thy throne (ix. 4),</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">so, too, the same is said of the Word:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine all-powerful Word leaped from heaven out of the royal throne (xviii. 15).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The nature of Wisdom, as portrayed in this book, has been
well summed up in the following words: “Wisdom is not an
attribute, nor the sum of the attributes, of God: such an
explanation would not take account of all the properties
postulated of Wisdom, nor would it allow for the completeness
of the Divine transcendence. Wisdom, again, is not God
in manifestation; she is too distinct from Him to be merely
a theoretical aspect of Himself. Lastly, she is not a Being,
personal and distinct from God: she emanates from Him,
but the emanation has not terminated. No birth-severance
has taken place, giving her independent life.”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Finally, it will not be amiss to take a glance, though it
be but a very slight one, at the teaching concerning Wisdom
which is given in some of the Apocalyptic books of which
mention has been made in the preceding chapter. It is true,
these books do not belong to the Wisdom Literature, nevertheless
some of them contain teaching on the subject of
Wisdom which may appropriately find a brief consideration
here. We have already seen that in some of the earlier
books of the Old Testament materials are to be discerned
out of which the Wisdom Literature developed; as there
were, therefore, these early seeds out of which the Wisdom
Literature grew, so in some of the Apocalyptic books an
after-growth may also be discerned. While the full fruit
is to be seen in the books with which we have just been
concerned, it is well to realize that some fruit is also to be
gathered outside of these. It will be sufficient for our
purpose if we illustrate what has to be said from three
Apocalyptic books, viz. the Book of Enoch, the Similitudes
of Enoch and the Secrets of Enoch.</p>

<p>In the oldest portions of the Book of Enoch there is no
mention of Wisdom,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> unless xci. 10 be included among
these.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> This passage runs:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the righteous shall arise from their sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Wisdom shall arise and be given unto them.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the next oldest part, the “Dream Visions,” the thought
which has already come before us of Wisdom sitting on the
throne of God, finds expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisdom departs not from the place of Thy throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Nor turns away from Thy presence (lxxxiv. 3).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But it is in the “Similitudes” that we find a number of
passages dealing with the subject; in fact, all these “Similitudes,”
or “Parables,” are declared to be the outcome of
the Wisdom which the Lord of Spirits granted to Enoch
(see xxxvii. 1-4, and cp. lxxxii. 2, 3). Differing from the
teaching of earlier Wisdom books<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> it is here stated that
Wisdom could nowhere find a dwelling-place among men,
and had therefore to return to heaven (cp. the passage just
quoted):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">Wisdom found no place where she might dwell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Then a dwelling-place was assigned her in the heavens.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisdom went forth to make her dwelling among the children of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">But found no dwelling-place;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Wisdom returned to her place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And took her seat among the angels (xlii. 1, 2; cp. xciv. 5).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is the Elect One, sitting on the throne of God, Who
possesses all the secrets of Wisdom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Elect One shall in those days sit on my Throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his mouth shall pour forth all the secrets of wisdom and counsel:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the Lord of Spirits hath given them to him, and hath glorified him (li. 3; cp. xlix. 3).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The blessedness of those who accept Wisdom is described
in xcix. 10.</p>

<p>In the Book of the Secrets of Enoch there is at least one
passage in which Wisdom is personified; it is a very curious
one repeating with strange details the thought that Wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
as taught in earlier books, took her part in the Creation; the
words are put into the mouth of the Creator:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>On the sixth day I ordered my Wisdom to make man of seven
substances: his flesh from the earth; his blood from the dew; his
eyes from the sun; his bones from the stones; his thoughts from the
swiftness of the angels, and the clouds; his veins [or “nails”] and
hair from the grass of the earth; his spirit from my spirit, and from
the wind (xxx. 8).</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in other passages, e.g. xxxiii. 3, xliii. 2, Wisdom is
conceived of as purely abstract.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHXI_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>The Wisdom Literature is preserved in both canonical
and uncanonical books; but the distinction is here unimportant,
for those belonging to either category are clearly
members of the same family; they all possess one characteristic
distinguishing them from the rest of the Old
Testament, viz. in them religion has become philosophy.
Not philosophy in the Greek sense, nor yet in that of the
moderns, but still religious philosophy of a distinct type.
The fundamental Jewish monotheistic belief is taken for
granted throughout. There are, however, other characteristics
not altogether in accord with traditional Judaism.
The writers of the Wisdom Literature are not always consistent
with one another, or even with themselves, and their
speculations are often only tentative. This is not surprising,
for they were struggling with new ways of thinking and with
new subjects of thought; and they were, moreover, coming
into contact with new influences.</p>

<p>In the Wisdom Literature certain positions taken up show
some variance with tradition; thus, the wise men present
a very interesting combination of universalism and conservatism;
little stress is laid on national institutions and
laws such as the sacrificial system; in like manner the
Messianic expectation receives very scant recognition. The
attitude towards the Gentiles is generally friendly; their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
higher culture is recognized, and there is willingness to learn
from them. Not infrequently the God of the Jews is declared
to be the God of all men. Most striking is the conception,
which is quite un-Jewish, of the divine <em>Sophia</em> which is
conceived of as a creative power existing before the Creation.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between the conceptions of
Wisdom in pre-exilic writings, and those of the Wisdom
Literature proper; but without doubt the former contain
the seeds whose growth is seen in the latter. Yet while it
is true that the religious-intellectual spirit to which the
Wisdom Literature owed its existence was an indigenous
plant, yet the elements which contributed to its development
were not exclusively Jewish. Babylonian influence was
at work before, as well as during, the Captivity, and Greek
influence is to be discerned later.</p>

<p>It is not possible to say when ideas about Wisdom began
to manifest themselves in Israel. The earliest form of
Wisdom is presented by what the Hebrews called a <em>māshāl</em>,
usually translated “proverb,” but having a wider signification,
being used of a prophetic figurative discourse such as
was uttered by Balaam, or a parable or allegory of the kind
found in the Book of Ezekiel. In its earlier use, however,
<em>māshāl</em> did mean a “proverb,” i.e. a sentence expressing
some truth, not necessarily religious or ethical, which had
been reached by experience or observation.</p>

<p>The Hebrew words for “Wisdom” (<em>Chokmah</em>) and for
“wise men” (<em>Chakāmîm</em>) are found fairly frequently in
the Pentateuch as well as in the prophetic and historical
books; but the usual meaning in these differs from that
found in the Wisdom Literature.</p>

<p>Of the several conceptions of Wisdom in the Wisdom
Literature the most important is that expressed in the well-known
words: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
Wisdom”; this occurs again and again in varying form,
its real meaning being that the fear of the Lord is the <em>end</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
of Wisdom, its highest and most perfect form. In this
Literature there is always a religious content in Wisdom;
it is never used of pure knowledge. In Proverbs and
Ecclesiastes there is much about worldly wisdom, but the
faculty of distinguishing between good and evil always
comes from God.</p>

<p>The personification of Wisdom found in this Literature
is of far-reaching importance. We must neither read into
the passages which treat of this a meaning they were not
intended to bear, nor must we explain away the meaning
that was really intended. When among the Jewish sages of
old Wisdom was personified, they thought of a personality
existing alongside of God, an intermediate being between
God and the world. This is more or less parallel to the
personification or quasi-personification of attributes proper
to God which is found in early post-Christian Jewish writings.
The special importance of this conception of Wisdom lies not
only in the fact that it forms the link between the Palestinian
and Hellenic development of Judaism, but also that it
represents the contribution made by the Wisdom Literature
to the Christology of the New Testament, and has, moreover,
greatly influenced Christian theology.</p>

<p>In the earlier portions of Proverbs, Wisdom is always
presented as something abstract, except perhaps in xvii. 24.
A real personification is found in the later parts. In Job
it is the wisdom of experience that normally finds expression;
but there is a definite personification in xxxviii. 12-28. In
Ecclesiastes Wisdom is always something abstract, and, a
unique element, the estimate of Wisdom is affected by the
Preacher’s pessimism. In Ecclesiasticus all that is taught
in the other books about Wisdom finds expression, with the
exception of the pessimism of Ecclesiastes; the identification
of the Law with Wisdom is a striking characteristic.
The Jewish-Hellenistic writer of the Book of Wisdom
identifies Wisdom with the holy spirit of the Lord, as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
as with the Word (in the Jewish sense), and teaches its
divine origin and its existence before the creation of the
world (this is common to the Wisdom Literature generally).</p>

<p>A brief glance at the teaching concerning Wisdom in the
Apocalyptic Literature shows that there is very little in the
earliest parts of the Book of Enoch, but there are a number
of passages which touch the subject in the “Similitudes,”
some of which have peculiar features. In the Secrets of
Enoch Wisdom is represented as taking part in the Creation.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<h3 class="p4" id="PI_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs135">The Doctrinal Teaching of the Apocrypha</span></h3>


<h4 id="PI_CHXII_PRE"><span class="smcap">Preliminary Remarks</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">It would be difficult to point to anything which illustrates
more clearly the arbitrary way in which the books of
the Apocrypha have been separated off from the rest of
the Jewish uncanonical religious literature of the period
with which we are dealing than the study of the doctrinal
teaching of this literature. For in the Apocrypha only part
of that teaching is represented; to obtain it in its fulness,
so far as the literature of the period is extant, we have to
consult such pseudepigraphic works as the Book of Enoch,
the Sibylline Oracles, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs,
the Book of Jubilees, the Psalms of Solomon, the Assumption
of Moses, the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch, and the
Ascension of Isaiah. But to take all these into consideration
here is out of the question, and we have already given a brief
outline of the more important doctrines taught in them
(<a href="#PI_CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>). There is, however, one compensation in restricting
ourselves to the books of the Apocrypha; for the more
important of these were recognized by official Judaism
as containing good orthodox teaching; so that in dealing
with this body of literature alone we are at all events on
more or less secure ground as far as orthodox Judaism is
concerned, and to get at that as a foundation is useful for
the further observance of the development of doctrine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
At the same time, it is necessary to bear in mind that while
in most respects the books of the Apocrypha afford, speaking
generally, a criterion for the period <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200-<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 100 as to
orthodox Jewish teaching, in some respects they are inadequate,
in others even insufficient, so that in such cases
recourse must be had to the Apocalyptic Literature,
though we cannot here take that Literature into fuller
consideration.</p>

<p>Now in dealing with the Judaism of this period we must
again emphasize what has already been stated several times,
namely the existence of the external influences by which it
was affected. The background of the Apocrypha books
in the domain of doctrine is not solely the Old Testament,
though this is, of course, their chief source of inspiration;
but there have also been marked Persian and Greek influences
in certain directions; it is essential that this should be
recognized. This point has been admirably dealt with by
Fairweather, and some of his words are well worth quoting;
he rightly says that there have been “two great streams of
influence flowing in upon the Jewish theology of this period,
an Eastern and a Western, a Persian and a Greek. Of these
by far the stronger was the Greek, though the Persian is as
distinctly traceable ... the Persian current was that of
Zoroastrianism; the Greek cannot be associated with a
single name. Out of these two forces, which were new, or
newly felt, active upon the native Judaism of Palestine,
which was old, was formed that <em>third</em> which we meet within
the home of Jewish theology of the period. But there was
also a Jewish theology outside of Palestine altogether. Not
only did foreign influences flow in upon Judaism, but
Judaism, now no longer confined to Palestine, went out to
meet them. Thus the hitherto unbroken river of Old Testament
ideas and doctrines divided itself at this point into
three separate streams. One, the main current, continued
to flow on in Palestine; while on the east and west of it ran<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
two other streams—the one through Persian territory, and
the other through Greek. The tributaries of Persian and
Greek ideas by which these streams respectively were fed
necessarily caused their waters to be of a composite character,
exceedingly difficult to analyse so as to say definitely,
‘This is Jewish, that is Persian,’ or ‘This is Jewish, that
is Greek,’”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The main current of which Fairweather speaks
represents Palestinian Judaism, while the other two streams
powerfully affected the Judaism of the Dispersion; the
differences between these two types of Judaism must be
taken into consideration, for both types are represented in
the books of the Apocrypha. We must also seek, as far as
possible, to follow the teaching of the various books in chronological
order. Differences of opinion exist, to be sure,
regarding the actual dates of these, but there is in almost all
cases approximate unanimity as to the <em>centuries</em> to which
they belong. In some instances different parts of a book
belong to different times; this will be taken into consideration
where necessary. When, therefore, quotations are given
to illustrate some point of doctrine they will be put, as
far as possible, in chronological order; see the table on <a href="#Page_320">p. 320.</a></p>

<p>The doctrines to be dealt with are the following:</p>

<p class="pad2 noindent">
(<i>a</i>) The Doctrine of God.<br>
(<i>b</i>) The Doctrine of the Law.<br>
(<i>c</i>) The Doctrine of Sin.<br>
(<i>d</i>) The Doctrine of Grace and Free-will.<br>
(<i>e</i>) The Doctrine of the Messiah.<br>
(<i>f</i>) The Doctrine of the Future Life.<br>
(<i>g</i>) The Doctrine of Angels.<br>
(<i>h</i>) Demonology.<br>
</p>

<p>The very important doctrine of Wisdom has already been
considered in <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>.</p>

<p>In dealing with these doctrines we shall only make cursory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
mention of those points in which the teaching of the Apocrypha
is identical with that of the Old Testament, as our main
object is to try and show in what respects the books of the
Apocrypha exhibit an advance in doctrine upon the Old
Testament, or, as in some cases, a retrogression; at the
same time the characteristic form in which a book presents
any particular doctrine will be noted even in those cases in
which there is no essential difference between the Old Testament
and the Apocrypha. It will not always be possible
to keep the various doctrines entirely separate from each
other, as one so often leads into another; so that some little
repetition may at times be unavoidable.</p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_a">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Doctrine of God.</i></h4>

<p>The Old Testament teaching on the Personality of God is,
as one would expect, so full, that we must not look for much
advance in the books of the Apocrypha on this subject.
The Unity of God the Creator of all, His eternity and
omnipotence, His activity in nature, His wisdom, holiness,
justice, loving-kindness and mercy, His Fatherhood of
Israel, and sometimes of all flesh—these doctrines are all
amply dealt with in Ecclesiasticus. In the fine passage
Ecclesiasticus xlii. 15-xliii. 33, where Ben-Sira gets his
inspiration largely from the Psalms, the praise of God is
sung as the Lord of Nature; there are one or two points in
this passage which, to some extent, witness to an advance upon
what the Old Testament teaches; in xlii. 16 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">God’s holy ones have not the power</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To recount His wondrous works of might;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though God hath given strength to His hosts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To endure in the presence of His glory.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These words represent the Hebrew, which was misunderstood
by the Greek translator; the meaning of them is that not
even the angels<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> can declare God’s mighty works, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
though they stand in His presence; they are only able to
stand in that presence because they have received special
strength for the purpose. What spiritual beings, who thus
stand in the very presence of God, are unable to fathom, can
still less be understood by men, all they can do is to offer
praise to God; so Ben-Sira says later in the same section:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">We will sing praises, because we cannot fathom;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For greater is He than all His works.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Terrible is Jehovah exceedingly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wonderful are His mighty acts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye that magnify Jehovah, lift up your voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As much as ye can, for there is still more!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye that exalt Him, renew your strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And weary not, for ye cannot fathom Him!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who hath seen Him, that he may tell thereof?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And who shall magnify Him as He is?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The number of things mysterious is greater even than these,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I have seen but few of His works (xliii. 28-32).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The conception of God which is revealed in these two passages
does certainly seem to be a higher one even than is
anywhere to be found in the Old Testament. In Tobit much
the same general conception is found as in the Old Testament;
but one passage may be quoted as showing a universalistic
spirit which is found only in some of the most exalted utterances
of the prophets; in xiv. 6 it is said that “all the
nations which are in the whole earth, all shall turn and fear
God truly; and all shall leave their idols, who err after
their false error.” Fully in accordance with the belief that
Jehovah is the God of all men is the way in which the writer
of this book never tires of speaking of Him under various
titles expressive of the sincerest praise and faith; no book
of the Apocrypha has such a variety of names for God as
this one. Another important point is that God hears the
prayers of men through angelic mediation. In great
contrast to this high conception of God is that found in
Judith; for while the power of God to help His chosen ones
in face of the most adverse circumstances is strongly insisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
upon, the idea that God’s favour is only accorded to those
who keep the Law, and that He is only the God of the Jews,
which is implied throughout even if not definitely stated, is
a very inadequate one and takes us back to some of the least
exalted passages of the Old Testament which deal with the
doctrine of God. A special note, though in no sense new
in itself, is sounded in the Prayer of Manasses, where
great stress is laid upon the divine compassion; the
opening verses form a beautiful hymn of praise to God. In
turning to the secondary text of Ecclesiasticus, which comes
next in order, we have in the addition to xxiv. 23 (= 24 in
the A.V.) a striking instance of the Pharisaic doctrine of God,
both as regards the divine Personality as well as the relationship
between Him and His true worshippers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Faint not, but be strong in the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And cleave unto Him that He may strengthen you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cleave unto Him; the Lord, the Almighty, is the One and only God;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And beside Him there is no Saviour.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The great characteristic, so far as the present subject is
concerned, of this secondary text, or Pharisaic recension,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
of Ecclesiasticus is that of the closeness of God to those who
love Him; personal religion, that religious individualism
which did so much to foster spiritual worship, finds true
expression here; not that the original writer was wanting
in deep piety, in spite of what often strikes one as a somewhat
worldly spirit, but as compared with the Pharisaic ideal of
the beginning of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it is not surprising to
find that the book was considered in some respects wanting,
and that it seemed to the more ardent religious temperament
of the Pharisees as not sufficiently expressive of the close
relationship between God and His pious ones. This may
be illustrated by one or two examples of the way additions
are made to the original text. In i. 12 Ben-Sira says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fear of the Lord delighteth the heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And giveth gladness, and joy, and length of days;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but the Pharisee deepens the sentiment by adding:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fear of the Lord is a gift from the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For it setteth men upon paths of love.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another example is found in the addition to xvii. 20. Ben-Sira
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Their iniquities are not hid from Him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all their sins are inscribed before the Lord;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to this the Pharisaic glossator adds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the Lord, being merciful, knowing also that they are made in His own image,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Spared them, and forsook them not, nor cast them off.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The closeness of God to those who love Him is again brought
out in the addition to xvii. 26<sup><i>a</i></sup>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For He Himself will lead thee out of darkness unto the light of salvation.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There are, of course, other passages of a similar kind. The
interest of these lies in the fact that they breathe the same
spirit which we find in a number of the later Psalms, and
which are believed by many scholars to emanate from the
circle of the <em>Chassidim</em> or “Pious ones,” the forerunners
of the Pharisees; this spirit reappears in the Psalms of
Solomon, which are admittedly the work of a Pharisee,
or Pharisees. In 1 Maccabees we find the strange
characteristic of the non-mention of the name of God,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
which never occurs in the original text, though it is sometimes
inserted in the Authorized Version; on the other
hand, a true faith in the omnipotence of God is at times
expressed, e.g. iii. 18: “There is no difference in the sight
of Heaven to save by many or by few; for victory in battle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
standeth not in the multitude of an host, but strength is from
Heaven”; and trust in God as the God of Israel Who will
help His people against their foes occurs not infrequently,
e.g. in iv. 10, 11: “And now let us cry unto Heaven, if He
will have mercy upon us, and will remember the covenant
of the fathers, and destroy this army before our face to-day,
and then will all the Gentiles know that there is One Who
redeemeth and saveth Israel.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> In all three of the documents
which make up the Book of Baruch stress is laid on
God’s guidance of Israel’s destiny; in the portion, Baruch
iv. 5-v. 9 the special characteristic is that the divine compassion
is constantly recalled, for which reason the writer
again and again bids his hearers be of “good cheer.” The
writer of 2 (4) Esdras fully represents the best of the Old
Testament teaching concerning the doctrine of God; he
insists on the unity of God, His Creatorship wholly without
any mediatorial agency; Israel is the specially elected nation
with which God has entered into a covenant relation. The
problems with which the seer is presented are insoluble for
man, who cannot even comprehend the material things of
the world, much less the spiritual secrets of Heaven: “...
He said moreover unto me, What belongs to thee, (namely)
the things that have intermingled with thy growth, thou art
incapable of understanding; how then should thy vessel be
able to comprehend the way of the Most High? For the
way of the Most High hath been found without measure;
how, then, should it be possible for a mortal in a corruptible
world to understand the ways of the Incorruptible?” (iv. 10,
11). The writer’s faith in God is specially shown forth by
his conviction that in spite of all appearances God’s love is
for His people: “Just as thou art unable to do even one of
these that have been mentioned, even so art thou powerless
to discover my judgement or the goal of the love that I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
declared unto My people” (v. 40). With the Book of Wisdom
we enter a religious atmosphere which is to a large extent
alien to that of Palestine; whether the two parts of this
book were written by different authors, or whether they are
both from the same author writing at different periods of
his life, it is quite clear that the presentation of the doctrine
of God in each is entirely different; the first part (i.-xi. 1)
is more Greek than Jewish, and “in nothing,” says Holmes,
“is this more clearly shown than in the idea of God presented
by the two parts respectively. The idea of God in
part i. is that of Greek philosophy, a transcendent God Who
has no immediate contact with the world. It is true that in
the later parts of the Old Testament the writers had largely
abandoned the conception of Jahveh as a God Who had
direct dealings with mankind.... God gradually became
thought of as more and more remote, though even in Daniel
the scene where the Ancient of Days sits in judgement on the
nations shows that God could be still thought of as having
immediate dealings with mankind. In Wisdom, however,
in chapters i.-x. we find that the author conceives God to
be so remote, that He performs His will by means of an
intermediary, whom He sends forth into the world (ix. 10).
This intermediary is Wisdom, and possesses all the attributes
of Deity. She is omnipotent (vii. 27), omniscient (viii. 8
and ix. 11), and puts these attributes into action; she
administers all things well (viii. 1).”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> In the second half
of the book God is again and again spoken of as interfering
personally in the affairs of men; a striking example
is given in xiv. 1 ff., which speaks of the folly of a navigator
who prays for safety to an idol before embarking upon his
vessel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For that vessel the hunger for gain devised,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And an artificer by his wisdom built it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Thy providence, O Father, guideth it along,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because even in the sea Thou gavest a way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in the waves a sure path;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Showing that Thou canst save out of every danger....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In other respects also the second part of this book represents
the Old Testament doctrine, more especially in its insistence
upon the need of right worship, and in the way in which it
deals with the mercy and justice of God.</p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_b">(<i>b</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Law.</i></h4>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus much stress is laid upon the importance of
the Law both from the ethical and ritual point of view,
a fact which shows this book to be a valuable link between
the Judaism of post-exilic times and Rabbinical Judaism.
The first point to note is the nature of the Law as taught by
Ben-Sira; it is eternal, and it is divine, for it has been given
by God, the Eternal One. The existence of the Law before
the beginning of the world is involved by Ben-Sira’s identification
of it with Wisdom. This is a conception which, so
far as is known, occurs here for the first time; but the way in
which this identification seems to be taken for granted
shows that it cannot have been wholly new to Ben-Sira’s
hearers; in speaking about the search for Wisdom he says, for
example, in xv. 1:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For he that feareth the Lord doeth this [i.e. seeketh Wisdom],</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he that taketh hold of the Law findeth her [i.e. Wisdom].</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Law and Wisdom are used again as synonymous terms
in xxxiv. (xxxi. in the Greek) 8:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Without deceit shall the Law be fulfilled.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And Wisdom is perfect in a mouth that is faithful.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Perhaps the most striking example of the way in which the
two are identified with each other is in xxiv. 23, where
Ben-Sira speaks of things concerning Wisdom, saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">All these things are the book of the covenant of God Most High,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The Law which Moses commanded as an heritage for the assemblies of Jacob.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Equally direct are the words in xix. 20:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">All wisdom is the fear of the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all wisdom is the fulfilling of the Law.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The “fear of the Lord,” as is often said by Ben-Sira, is both
the true observance of the Law, and the “beginning,” or
zenith, of Wisdom. The constant insistence upon the need of
observing the Law is characteristic of this book; the following
passage offers a good example out of many:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He that seeketh out the Law shall gain her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the hypocrite shall be snared thereby....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In all thy works guard thyself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For he that so doeth keepeth the commandment.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He that observeth the Law guardeth himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he that trusteth in Jehovah shall not be brought to shame (xxxii. 15-24).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ben-Sira urges men not to be ashamed of the Law (xlii. 2),
and loves to remind his hearers of how their great ancestors
observed it and were enlightened by it, and taught it to
others (see xliv. 20, xlv. 5, 17, xlvi. 14); and he also teaches
that the fulfilling of the precepts of the Law is to be the chief
concern in view of the inevitableness of death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Remember thy last end, and cease from enmity;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Remember corruption and death, and abide in the commandments (xxviii. 6).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another point of importance in this connection is Ben-Sira’s
teaching on the spirit in which the precepts of the Law
should be carried out; in xxxiv. 18, 19 (in the Greek xxxi.
21-23) he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacrifice of the unrighteous man is a mocking offering,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And unacceptable are the oblations of the godless.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Most High hath no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither doth He forgive sins for a multitude of sacrifices.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Somewhat different in character, but breathing quite the
same spirit, are the following words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He who washeth after contact with a dead body, and toucheth it again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What has he gained by his bathing?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So a man fasting for his sins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And again doing the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who will listen to his prayer?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And what hath he gained by his humiliation (verses 25, 26).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That the Law, according to Ben-Sira, was now meant only
for Israel, whatever might originally have been the case,
may be gathered from the following, when it is remembered
that, as already shown, Wisdom and the Law are identified
with each other; Wisdom is represented as speaking thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">With all these [i.e. every people and nation] I sought a resting-place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And said: In whose inheritance shall I lodge?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the Creator of all things gave me commandment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He that created me fixed my dwelling-place for me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And He said: Let thy dwelling-place be in Jacob,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And in Israel take up thine inheritance....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I took root among an honoured people,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the portion of the Lord and of His inheritance (xxiv. 7 f., 12).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We may recall here that according to the teaching of the
Rabbis in later centuries the Law was originally intended by
God to be a revelation of Himself and of His will to all
nations, but that the only nation which accepted it was
Israel.</p>

<p>In the Book of Tobit we meet with an earnest zeal for the
fulfilments of legal precepts combined with deep devotion.
This book is important for the indications it offers of the
development of legal observances. Prayer, almsgiving and
fasting are strongly advocated (xii. 8), but more especially
almsgiving, which is again and again insisted upon, e.g.:
“Give alms of thy substance; turn not away thy face from
any poor man, and the face of God shall not be turned away
from thee. As thy substance is, give alms of it according to
thine abundance; if thou have much, according to the
abundance thereof give alms; if thou have little, bestow it,
and be not afraid to give alms according to that little....”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
(iv. 6-11). The laws of tithe (i. 7, v. 13), marriage (vi. 12,
vii. 13, 14), honouring parents (iv. 3), keeping the feasts
(i. 6, ii. 1), purifying oneself (ii. 5), as well as others, are all
inculcated. This love for the Law, combined with worship,
i.e. prayer, observance of the feasts, and zeal for the honour
of God, offers a fine illustration of the truly pious Jew of this
period. The observance of the Law appears as a real
delight, there is no hint of its being irksome; in this the
book is a commentary on the psalmist’s words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, how I love Thy Law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is my meditation all the day (Ps. cxix. 97).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In no book of the Apocrypha is the observance of the Law
more strongly advocated than in Judith; while everything
depends upon trust in God and obedience to Him, both are
shown forth by keeping the Law which He gave; righteousness
is only through the Law. As in the majority of the
books of the Apocrypha there is no abstract conception
concerning the Law, its practical observance only is taught.
Thus in viii. 5, 6 it is said of Judith that “she made her a
tent upon the roof of her house, and put on sackcloth upon
her loins; and the garments of her widowhood were upon
her. And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the
eves of the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and the
new moons, and the feasts and joyful days of the house of
Israel.” This was all in accordance with traditional practice;
seclusion, mortification and fasting all belonged to the
<i lang="fr">rôle</i> of a widow’s mourning; it is, however, a development
that the eves of sabbaths, new moons and feasts were
observed, as here indicated. A further example of the need
of the strict observance of the Law is seen in xi. 12, 13, where
the sin of touching forbidden food is spoken of: “Since
their (i.e. the Jews’) victuals failed them, and all their water
was scant, they took counsel to lay hands upon their cattle,
and determined to consume all those things which God
charged them by His laws that they should not eat; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
they are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the corn, and
the tenths of the wine and the oil, which they had sanctified
and reserved for the priests that stand before the face of our
God in Jerusalem; the which things it is not fitting for any
of the people so much as to touch with their hands.” Reference
is also made to the sacrificial system and the gifts of the
people in xvi. 18, but in the poem in xvi. 2-17 the right spirit
in offering is the really important matter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For all sacrifice is very little for a sweet savour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the fat is very little for a whole burnt-offering to Thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he that feareth the Lord is great continually.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The teaching concerning the Law in this book is thus strongly
Pharisaic.</p>

<p>In 1 Maccabees there is reflected the earnest zeal for the
Law on the part of the patriots; this has been referred to
with quotations above (Chap. II), so that it is not necessary
to say anything further here. Much stress is laid upon legal
observances in 2 Maccabees; in i. 8, 9 it is told how in
Jerusalem the Jews offered sacrifice and meal-offering,
lighted the lamps, and set forth the shewbread; and it is
enjoined that the feast of Tabernacles be kept in the month
Chislev. As in 1 Maccabees apostate Jews are severely
rebuked for following those who were unfaithful to the
Law (iv. 11-17), the passage concludes with the words:
“It is no light matter to act impiously against the laws of
God; time will show that.” Another passage which
illustrates the intense zeal for the Law is in chapter vii.,
where the story is told of the martyrdom of seven sons and
their mother who “died for His laws” (vii. 9). The whole
attitude towards the Law is that of the Pharisaic school of
about the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards; this also applies to
1 (3) Esdras.</p>

<p>In the document, Baruch iii. 9-iv. 4, where the Law and
Wisdom are identified, exiled Israel is told that the reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
of his punishment is the forsaking of God’s ways, the commandments
of life, i.e. the Law:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give ear to understand Wisdom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How happeneth it, O Israel, that thou art in thine enemies’ land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou art waxen old in a strange country...?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast forsaken the fountain of Wisdom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For if thou hadst walked in the way of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shouldst have dwelled in peace for ever.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Learn where is Wisdom, where is strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is understanding; that thou mayest also know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is length of days, and life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is the light of the eyes, and peace.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That the <em>Law</em> is meant by Wisdom, strength, and understanding
is clear from the words at the end of the piece,
iv. 1 ff.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the book of the commandments of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Law that endureth for ever;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All they that hold it fast are appointed to life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But such as leave it shall die....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The lasting endurance of the Law which is also taught here
frequently finds expression in the Rabbinical literature.
That the Law is for Israel alone seems to be implied in the
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Walk towards her shining in the presence of the light thereof;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give not thy glory to another,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Israel, happy are we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us (iv. 3, 4).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of the different portions which make up 2 (4) Esdras the
most important in the present connection is the “Salathiel
Apocalypse” which forms the bulk of the book (iii.—x.).
A good instance of this writer’s attitude towards the Law
together with a prophecy of the doom upon Israel for having
rejected it by sinning is ix. 31-37; first these words are
put into the mouth of God: “For behold, I sow my Law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
in you, and it shall bring forth fruit in you, and ye shall be
glorified in it for ever”; then the writer continues: “But
our fathers who received the Law observed it not, and the
statutes they did not keep, and yet the fruit of the Law did
not perish, nor could it, because it was Thine; but they
who received it perished, because they kept not that which
had been sown in them.... We who have received the
Law, and sinned, must perish, together with our heart,
which hath taken it in; the Law, however, perisheth not,
but abideth in its glory.” In accordance with later Rabbinical
teaching it is said in this book that the Law had originally
been given to other nations, by whom it was rejected, while
Israel alone accepted it: “And Thy glory went through
the four gates of fire, earthquake, wind and cold, to give
the Law to Jacob’s seed, and the commandment to the
generation of Israel” (iii. 19); on the other hand, in vii.
72 it is said: “Therefore shall the sojourners in the earth
suffer torture, because, having understanding, they yet
wrought iniquity, and receiving precepts, they yet kept them
not, and having obtained the Law they set at nought that
which they received.” Both Israel and the Gentiles thus
received, or had the chance of receiving, the Law, and both
by sinning perished in spite of the Law; the inadequacy of
the Law as a redemptive power here shown forth is very
striking; the reason why the Law was ineffective was,
according to iv. 30, because of “the grain of evil seed which
was sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning.” We
shall have to return to this when dealing with the doctrine
of Sin (see next section). In the other portions of this
book, so far as our present subject is concerned, the main
stress is laid on veneration for the Law.</p>

<p>We turn now to the Book of Wisdom, representing the
Judaism of the Dispersion, and here, as one would expect,
there is very little on this subject to be noted. In ii. 12
words are put into the mouth of the ungodly which show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
that the writer, at any rate, recognizes the Law and its
obligations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But let us lie in wait for the righteous, for he is of disservice to us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And is opposed to our doings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And upbraideth us with sins against the Law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And layeth to our charge sins against our discipline.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In vi. 4 rulers are denounced for not keeping the Law:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because being officers of his kingdom ye did not judge aright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither kept ye the Law, nor walked after the counsel of God.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the reference here is to foreign rulers there is an advance
in doctrine to be noted, for the Law is held to be obligatory
on others as well as on the Jews, and Gentile rulers are
regarded as having received their authority from God.</p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_c">(<i>c</i>) <i>The Doctrine of Sin.</i></h4>

<p>The prevalence of Sin is often spoken of in Ecclesiasticus;
Ben-Sira realizes its existence personally when he says in
xxii. 27:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O that one would set a watch over my mouth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a seal of shrewdness over my lips....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again in xxiii. 3 ff.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">That mine ignorances be not multiplied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And that my sins abound not....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Its universal prevalence is witnessed to by the words in
viii. 5:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Reproach not a man who repenteth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Remember that we are all guilty.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Punishment for every sin, Ben-Sira says, will assuredly
overtake sinners:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do not wickedly continue in sin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For in respect of one sin thou art not without guilt;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">i.e. every single sin carries guilt with it, the implication
being that it will therefore not go unpunished. Of great
interest and importance is the teaching in this book on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
origin of Sin; Ben-Sira mentions three theories; one of
these he combats, namely that the existence of Sin is due
to God; this is the belief, apparently, of certain freethinkers
against whom the following words are spoken:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not, “From God <ins class="corr" id="tn-268" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'is my trangression'">
is my transgression</ins>,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For that which He hateth made He not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not, “It is He that made me to stumble,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For there is no need of evil men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Evil and abomination doth the Lord hate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He doth not let it come nigh them that fear Him (xv. 11-13).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But since Ben-Sira believed that God was the Creator
of everything that exists, he sometimes comes perilously
near to uttering the very untruth which he here combats.
He says, for example, in xxxvii. 3:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O base nature! Why then wast thou created</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To fill the world’s face with deceit?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The words “base nature” are the rendering of the Hebrew
which is literally, “evil Yetzer”; the “Yetzer” is the bias
or natural inclination which is implanted in every man;
there is, therefore, in the words quoted, an implication that
this “evil Yetzer” was created by God. The same must
be said of another passage, xxxiii. (xxxvi. in the Greek)
13-15:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">As the clay is in the power of the potter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To fashion it according to his good pleasure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So is man in the power of his Creator,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To make him according to His ordinance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over against evil stands good, and against death life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Likewise over against the godly stands the sinner.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even thus look upon all the works of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Each different, one the opposite of the other.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this case, indeed, there is something more than an implication,
for the words seem to impute the origin of evil
directly to God. Yet it can hardly be that Ben-Sira believed
this; for in view of what he says in the first passage quoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
he regarded this as altogether wrong. The fact is that as
soon as he begins to grapple with this subject he involves
himself in difficulties; he tries another solution of the
problem, but as will be seen, this is no real solution; in
XXV. 24 he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">From a woman did sin originate [lit. “is the beginning of sin”],</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And because of her we all must die.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this only traces the history of Sin in the human race,
and does not touch upon its creation; moreover, it has to
be remembered that Ben-Sira usually regards Sin as something
external to man, something which comes to him from
outside (though exceptions to this will be referred to presently);
thus in xxi. 2, 3, for example, it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For if thou come nigh it, it will bite thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the teeth of a lion are the teeth thereof,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It slayeth the souls of men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a two-edged sword is all iniquity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the stroke thereof is no healing.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If Sin is external to man, as is so often said and implied in
this book, it must have existed somewhere before it was
appropriated by Eve, and thus originated in the human
race.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Nevertheless, in connection with what appears
to be a third theory, it is possible that Ben-Sira believed Sin
to be not external to man. For this third theory we must
consider first xxi. 27, 28:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When the fool curseth his adversary [lit. “Satan”],</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He curseth his own soul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The whisperer defileth his own soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And is hated whithersoever he sojourneth.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The meaning of this passage is no doubt difficult to determine;
but, to begin with, it seems clear that by the words,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
“The whisperer defileth his own soul,” Ben-Sira meant to
express the truth that the evil in man is of his own making;
it is also evident that the words are intended to be an illustration
of the truth enunciated in the preceding couplet.
Whatever is meant by “adversary”—whether “Satan”
in the sense of the Devil, or an adversary in a more general
signification—the words which follow (“He curseth his own
soul”) show that what Ben-Sira intends to teach is that
the “adversary” is synonymous with the ungodly man’s
own self; i.e. he, and he alone, is responsible for his sins.
So that the gist of the passage would seem to be that man is
his own “Satan”; in other words, that the origin of Sin is
to be sought in man since the initiative lies with him.
Another passage which may be quoted in this connection is
xvii. 31:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">What is brighter than the sun? Yet this faileth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And how much more man who hath the inclination of flesh and blood!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The text here is uncertain; the Hebrew is not extant
and the Versions differ, so that one cannot be sure about its
meaning. Dr. Tennant paraphrases the Greek thus:
“Even the sun darkens itself—the brightest thing in the
world; how much more, then, frail man!” And, in commenting
on the words, he says that if Ben-Sira offers any excuse
for man’s depravity “it is that of his natural and essential
frailty ... but [that he] never [attributes it] to an external
cause.” Difficult as the verse is, it is quite possible that what
was in Ben-Sira’s mind was that the origin of Sin was to
be found in man, for it is extremely doubtful whether he
differentiated between Sin as an abstract conception and
actual deeds of Sin committed by individuals. The idea
that seems to be adumbrated here as to the origin of Sin is,
in any case, true from one point of view, for it accords with
the facts of experience if human free-will is believed in,
and Ben-Sira does believe in this (see next section); for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
every sin committed originates, so far as any particular sin
is concerned, in man, whatever be the origin of the sinful
tendency. This can be illustrated by one other quotation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the sinner is ensnared through his lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the fool stumbleth through his mouth (xxiii. 8).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ben-Sira’s teaching concerning the origin of Sin may, then,
be summed up thus: He implies, though he hardly goes so
far as to make the definite assertion, that the origin of Sin
is due to God; yet in one important passage he strongly
combats this. He teaches, further, that so far as the
human race is concerned the origin of Sin is to be sought in
the fall of Eve, but he does not attempt to trace its history
further back; this was, however, from his point of view
unnecessary if, in accordance with his third theory, sin
originates in the individual; nevertheless, he involves
himself in a contradiction here in saying that because of
Eve’s sin all men must die. In addition to this, however,
there is a further inconsistency regarding this third theory,
for while teaching that Sin originates <em>in</em> man, he sometimes
speaks of it as something external to him. These contradictory
thoughts bring into clear relief Ben-Sira’s inability
to formulate a consistent and logical doctrine as to the
origin of Sin; and in this he but shows himself the forerunner
of the Rabbis, from whose writings it can be seen that these
later thinkers were involved in precisely the same inconsistencies
as soon as they attempted to construct a working
theory on the subject.</p>

<p>There is one other point connected with this subject to
which brief reference must be made, namely, the means
whereby sins are atoned for; the importance here lies in
the fact that the teaching of this book concerning atonement
for sins is the same as that of the later Rabbinical
literature; it is, therefore, a great development upon Old
Testament teaching. Ben-Sira follows the teaching of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
Old Testament in so far that he believes in the need of the
sacrificial system provided that sacrifices are offered in the
right spirit; he says, for example, in one place:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give a meal-offering with a memorial,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And offer a fat sacrifice to the utmost of thy means (xxxviii. 11);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but it depends upon the spirit of him who offers as to
whether the sacrifice is acceptable or not:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacrifice of the unrighteous man is a mocking offering,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And unacceptable are the oblations of the godless.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Most High hath no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither doth He forgive sins for a multitude of sacrifices</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(xxxiv. 18, 19, in the Greek xxxi. 21-23).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That sacrifices atoned for sins is a fundamental Old Testament
doctrine, but the other means of atonement which
Ben-Sira mentions show a development; these are as
follows; (one quotation in support of each must suffice for
illustration). Concerning Almsgiving it is said in iii. 30:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">A flaming fire doth water quench,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So doth almsgiving atone for sin.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That Fasting is an atonement is implied in the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... So a man fasting for his sins</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And doing the same again,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who will listen to his prayer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And what hath he gained by his humiliation?</div>
    <div class="verse indent13">(xxxiv. 26; in the Greek xxxi. 31).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another means of atonement is Death; this is seen, or at
any rate adumbrated, in the words in xviii. 22:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Delay not to pay thy vow in due time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wait not till death to be justified.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This last assumed ever-increasing importance with the
growth of the belief in the resurrection; in Ecclesiasticus
it is perhaps no more than adumbrated, for where there
was as yet no belief in the resurrection nor in punishment
for unatoned sins hereafter there was no inducement to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
formulate a doctrine as to the atoning efficacy of death;
the above-quoted passage is, however, worth giving as
illustrating a tendency. One other means of atonement
must be mentioned because it teaches the truth of mediatorship;
this is in xlv. 23:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Moreover Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was glorious in might as a third [i.e. after Moses and Aaron],</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that he was jealous for the God of all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And stood in the breach for his people,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While his heart prompted him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he made atonement for the children of Israel.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What little is found in the Book of Tobit concerning the
doctrine of Sin is connected with Demonology, which will be
considered in § (<i>h</i>). There is a reference to the atoning
efficacy of almsgiving in iv. 10, 11: “... Because alms
delivereth from death, and suffereth not to come into darkness.
Alms is a good offering in the sight of the Most High
for all that give it”; and especially xii. 9, “Almsgiving
doth deliver from death, and purgeth away all sin.” There
is nothing that calls for particular mention in the Book of
Judith; or in the Additions to Daniel, with the exception
of one interesting passage in the Prayer of Azariah, verse 12,
where it is said: “Cause not thy mercy to depart from us,
for the sake of Abraham that is beloved of Thee, and for
the sake of Isaac Thy servant, and Israel Thy holy one”;
so, too, in the Prayer of Manasses, verse 8, where it is
implied that the patriarchs are sinless: “Thou, therefore,
O Lord, that art the God of the righteous, hast not appointed
repentance unto the righteous, unto Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against Thee;
but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a
sinner.” This is important, for the same idea finds expression
in the later Rabbinical literature, and closely
connected with it is the doctrine of the merits of the fathers,
i.e. that the good deeds of the patriarchs and other great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
personalities in the history of Israel serve as an atonement
for their descendants. There is probably no book in the
Apocrypha in which such deep realization of sin is expressed
as in this short one; this is shown in verses 8-13:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the sins I have sinned are more in number than the sands of the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For my transgressions were multiplied, O Lord;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My transgressions were multiplied,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven by reason of the multitude of mine iniquities....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The next book that calls for notice is 2 Maccabees, on account
of its strangely particularistic doctrine of retribution for
sin; in vi. 12-16 it is said: “Now I beseech the readers
of this book not to be discouraged by such calamities,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
but to reflect that our people were being punished by way
of chastening, and not for their destruction. For indeed
it is a mark of great kindness when the impious are not let
alone for a long time, but punished at once. In the case
of other nations, the Sovereign Lord in His forbearance
refrains from punishing them till they have filled up their
sins to the full, but in our case He has determined otherwise,
that His vengeance may not fall on us in after-days
when our sins have reached their height....” The teaching
of this subject in 1 (3) Esdras and Baruch is that of the
Old Testament; but it is worth mentioning that the doctrine
of the merits of the fathers referred to above is expressly
repudiated in Baruch ii. 19: “For we do not present our
supplication before Thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness
of our fathers, and of our kings”; evidently this
doctrine must have been held by some, since it receives such
a pointed repudiation.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Sin in 2 (4) Esdras is important as it is
very fully dealt with; this will require a little more detailed
notice, but we can restrict ourselves to the “Salathiel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
Apocalypse” portion of the book (iii.-x.), as the other parts
do not offer anything of importance so far as this subject
is concerned. The origin of Sin is traced to Adam, as the
following passage (iii. 20-22, 25, 26) will show: “And yet
Thou didst not take away from them the evil heart, that
Thy Law might bring forth fruit in them. For the first
Adam, clothing himself with the evil heart, transgressed,
and was overcome; and likewise also all who were born of
him. Thus the infirmity became inveterate; the Law
indeed was in the heart of the people, but together with the
evil germ; so what was good departed, and the evil remained....
And, after this had been done many years, the
inhabitants of the city committed sin, in all things doing as
Adam and all his generations had done; for they also had
clothed themselves with the evil heart.” This teaching
occurs more than once; in iv. 30 it is said: “For a grain
of evil seed was sown in the heart of Adam from the beginning,
and how much fruit of ungodliness hath it produced
unto this time, and will yet produce until the threshing-floor
come!” And, once more, in vii. 118: “O thou Adam,
what hast thou done! For though it was thou who sinned,
the fall was not thine alone, but ours also who are thy
descendants!” Adam’s fall and sin in man are thus
directly connected, but how this connection came about
the writer nowhere says. From the passage quoted above,
however, it will be seen that the writer of this book recognizes
each man’s individual responsibility for his own sins
(“they also had clothed themselves with the evil heart”).
“It is noteworthy,” says Box,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> “that the form of the
apocalyptist’s conception is specifically Rabbinic. He
bases his conclusions on the <em>Yetzer ha-ra‘</em> [i.e. the “evil
tendency”]; there is no suggestion that the introduction
of evil into the world was due to external agents or forces.
The older mythological view (found in Genesis and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
older apocalyptic literature) that the fall of man was brought
about by demonic incitement is tacitly discarded. The
corruption of the human race is regarded as due to a development
of something inherent in man’s nature (the <em>Yetzer
ha-ra‘</em>). Though this doctrine is sometimes combined,
in the Rabbinical literature, with the popular view of Satan
(Satan works his evil purpose by the instrumentality of the
<em>Yetzer ha-ra‘</em>), it probably really represents a theological
refinement which was intended to supersede the older crude
popular ideas about demonic agency.... Where our
apocalyptist differs, and differs fundamentally, from the
orthodox doctrine of Judaism, expressed in the Rabbinical
literature, is in the emphasis he lays on the ravages of the
evil <em>Yetzer</em> upon human nature generally. The enfeeblement
of man’s nature is such that practically no one has
been able successfully to withstand the <em>Yetzer</em>; the whole
race has fallen into corruption. The Rabbis insisted, on
the other hand, that human nature is not, by any means,
in such a hopeless condition. Man can, by moral effort and
assisted by the grace of God, successfully resist the suggestions
of the evil impulse.” In this book, therefore, it is
taught that Sin is universal among men: “For in truth
there is none of the earth-born that has not dealt wickedly,
and among those that exist that has not sinned” (viii. 35);
and therefore the writer’s sense of sin is very pronounced:
“For the evil heart has grown up in us, which has estranged
us from God, and brought us into destruction; and has
made known unto us the ways of death, and showed us
the paths of perdition, and removed us far from life; and
that not a few only, but well-nigh all that have been
created!” Turning now to the Book of Wisdom, we may note
first that the writer believed in an original state of good:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Court not death in the error of your life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither draw upon yourselves destruction by the works of your hands;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because God made not death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither delighteth He when the living perish.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For He created all things that they might have being,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the products of the world are healthsome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there is no poison of destruction in them ... (i. 12 ff.).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Still more explicit are the words in viii. 19, 20:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now I was a child good by nature, and a good soul fell to my lot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nay rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Without going into the question here of the writer’s belief
whether, and in what manner, the soul pre-existed, it is
clear enough that he did not believe in the innate sinfulness
of human nature. In the second part of the book, however,
a somewhat different attitude is taken, for in xii. 10, 11,
when speaking about the Canaanites, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But judging them by little and little Thou gavest them a place of repentance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Though Thou knewest their nature was evil, and their wickedness inborn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that their manner of thought would in no wise ever be changed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For they were a seed accursed from the beginning;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither was it through fear of any that Thou didst pass over their sins.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The view here held is quite contrary to that found in the
two former quotations which suggest a different authorship
for the two parts of the book. This is also borne out by
what is said regarding death, as the result of Adam’s sin
presumably; for in ii. 23, 24 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because God created man for incorruption,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And made him an image of His own proper being.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But by the envy of the devil death entered into the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they that belong to his realm experience it.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Death, which is the result of Sin, was thus not originally
intended to come upon the human race. But in the second
part of the book there is no hint of this. The first part
of the Book of Wisdom is, therefore, quite unique among the
books of the Apocrypha on this subject; the second part
offers nothing that is new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_d">(<i>d</i>) <i>The Doctrine of Grace and Free-will.</i></h4>

<p>A true balance is kept in Ecclesiasticus between Grace and
Free-will; many passages could be cited to show this, but
the few following will suffice. In speaking of the ideal
scribe, Ben-Sira says (xxxix. 6):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">If it seem good to God Most High,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He [i.e. the scribe] shall be filled with the spirit of understanding;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He himself poureth forth wise sayings in double measure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And giveth thanks unto the Lord in prayer.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, in i. 14 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">To fear the Lord is the beginning [i.e. the essence] of Wisdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And with the faithful she was created in the womb.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Equally definite is Ben-Sira’s teaching on Free-will; he
says, e.g. in xv. 15-17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou so desirest thou canst keep the commandment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it is wisdom to do His good pleasure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poured out before thee are fire and water,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Stretch forth thine hand unto that which thou desirest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life and death are before man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That which he desireth shall be given to him.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Both truths are combined in the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou desire Wisdom keep the commandments,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the Lord will give her freely unto thee.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The important point about Ben-Sira’s teaching here is the
way in which he combines the two apparently opposing
truths; he shows that they are not mutually contradictory,
but complementary. He thus continues the teaching of
the Old Testament concerning the omnipotence of God
and the responsibility of man.</p>

<p>In the Book of Tobit similar teaching is found; for
example in iv. 5 Tobit says to his son Tobias: “My child,
be mindful of the Lord all thy days, and let not thy will
be set to transgress His commandments; do acts of righteousness
all the days of thy life, and walk not in the ways
of unrighteousness.” But that divine grace is needed for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
this is taught in iv. 19: “Bless the Lord thy God at all
times, and ask of Him that thy ways may be made straight,
and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper.” In
the rest of the books belonging to this century nothing
calls for particular note under this heading; but in the
secondary text of Ecclesiasticus the same balance of doctrine
is found as in the original book; thus, dependence on God
and the reception of the gift of love from Him are expressed
in the addition to xvii. 17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom [i.e. Israel] He brought up as His first-born</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With severity, yet loving them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imparting to them the light of love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He forsook them not.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Man has, however, his part to play, for in the addition to
xx. 31 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Better is persistent endurance in seeking the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Than a driver of his own life without a master.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1 Maccabees the doctrinal subject under consideration
is closely connected with the doctrine of God as presented
in this book. We have seen above that direct divine
intervention in the nation’s affairs is not nearly as prominently
expressed here as in the books of the Old Testament;
and it has also been already remarked that God is never
mentioned by name in the whole book. The writer is
certainly not wanting in earnest belief and faith in God;
his conviction of the existence of an all-seeing Providence
is clear from many passages; but he also has a strong
belief in the truth expressed by the modern proverb that
“God helps those who help themselves.” This attitude
was largely due to the influence of certain tendencies which
were beginning to assert themselves. These centred round
the doctrine of God. Just as there was a disinclination,
on account of its transcendent holiness, to utter the name
of God, and instead to substitute paraphrases for it, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
there arose also a disinclination to ascribe action among men
directly to God on account of His inexpressible majesty.
One result of this was the further tendency to emphasize
and extend the scope of human free-will. We find, therefore,
in this book that much more emphasis is laid on free-will
than on divine grace. In the Additions to Esther it
is just the other way about; for here human free-will is
scarcely taken into account, while the divine activity
among men is throughout insisted upon. But in both this
book and 1 Maccabees there can be no doubt that the one-sided
emphasis on divine grace and human free-will respectively
was prompted by the particular subject-matter of
either book.</p>

<p>In the case of 2 Maccabees, though written with a definitely
religious object, there is very little to note under
the present heading; the frequent stress laid, however,
on the fact that the Jews are God’s chosen people, and
therefore under His special protection and guidance, is
a point to be borne in mind. The next book to be considered
is 2 (4) Esdras, and here again it is only the “Salathiel
Apocalypse” that claims attention. “The writer’s
intense sense of sinfulness, and his conviction of man’s
inability to acquire justification by the works of the Law,
impel him to throw himself wholly upon the divine compassion;
he despairs of a life of absolute obedience to the
Law, even by Israel, not to speak of the world. The unconscious
and unexpressed cry of the book is for a moral dynamic,
which legalism could not supply.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> This deeply religious
writer must, therefore, perforce have looked to divine grace
where human will-power was helpless. As we should expect,
in the Book of Wisdom the main stress is laid on free-will,
though the other side of the truth is not lost sight of. The
former is plainly taught in i. 12-16:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Court not death in the error of your life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither draw upon yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><hr class="tb"></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the ungodly by their hands and words called him [i.e. Hades] unto them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Deeming him a friend they were consumed with love of him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they made a covenant with him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because they are worthy to be of his portion.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, on the other hand, the opening words of the book bring
out in a very clear manner the indispensable need of divine
grace for the right exercise of the will:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Think ye of the Lord with a good mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in singleness of heart seek ye Him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For He is found of them that tempt Him not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And is manifested unto them that do not mistrust Him....</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And will start away from thoughts that are without understanding,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And will be scared away when the unrighteous approacheth (i. 1-5).</div>
</div>
</div>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_e">(<i>e</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Messiah.</i></h4>

<p>The didactic character of Ecclesiasticus is sufficient to
account for the extreme meagreness of references to the
Messiah. In the few cases in which the subject is referred
to it is the seed of David to which the Messiah belongs,
viz.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He will not cut off the posterity of His chosen ones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor will He destroy the offspring of them that love Him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And He will give to Jacob a remnant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And to the house of David a root from him (xlvii. 22).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And in the eighth verse of the Hymn of Praise which (in
the Hebrew only) is inserted after li. 12, occur these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give thanks unto Him that maketh a horn to sprout for the house of David,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For His mercy endureth for ever.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ben-Sira, therefore, believes in a Messiah who is purely
human, according to the usual Jewish doctrine, and who belongs
to the house of David; but his belief is otherwise vague.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Apart from the nature of the book itself, it must be remembered
that the conceptions of a Messiah were largely conditioned
by the historical circumstances of any given period;
during the time of Ben-Sira these were not of a nature to
call forth Messianic hopes, and therefore the teaching
regarding the Messiah was indefinite, and receded into the
background. In the Book of Tobit the Messiah is never
mentioned, but the renovated Jerusalem which the writer
speaks of, and the gathering in of the dispersed Israelites
as well as of the Gentiles, gives a picture of what corresponds
to the Messianic Kingdom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Jerusalem, thou holy city! He will chastise thee for the works of thy hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And will again have mercy on the sons of the righteous.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Give thanks to the Lord with goodness, and bless the everlasting King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thy tabernacle may be builded in thee again with joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And that He may make glad in thee all that are captives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And love in thee all that are miserable and all the generations of eternity.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bright light shall shine unto all the ends of the earth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Many nations shall come from afar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the inhabitants of the utmost ends of the earth unto Thy holy name ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent39">(xiii. 7-18; see also xiv. 4-6).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No other books of the Apocrypha offer any teaching
on this subject until we come to 1 Maccabees, where there
is conceivably in the mind of the writer the thought of the
Messiah in iv. 46, “... so they pulled down the altar,
and laid down the stones in the mountain of the House, in
a convenient place, until a prophet should come and decide
as to what should be done concerning them.” The reference
here is probably to Deuteronomy xviii. 18, which is not a
Messianic passage, though it may have been so interpreted in
later times. A somewhat more definite reference to the
Messiah is perhaps to be seen in xiv. 41: “And the Jews and
the priests were well pleased that Simon should be their leader
and high-priest for ever, until a faithful prophet should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
arise.” The words “for ever” mean that the high-priesthood
should continue hereditary in the house of the Hasmonæans,
so that if by “a faithful prophet” the Messiah is
meant, the writer would imply that the Messiah would be
of Hasmonæan lineage. In 2 Maccabees there is no reference
to the Messiah, though there is to the Messianic Kingdom,
for the gathering together of the scattered Israelites in
Jerusalem is an undoubted Messianic <em>trait</em>: “Gather together
our dispersion, set at liberty them that are in bondage
among the heathen.... Plant Thy people in Thy holy
place” (i. 27); and again in ii. 18: “In God have we hope,
that He will speedily have mercy upon us, and gather us
together from under the wide heaven to the holy place.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
In Baruch the Messianic Kingdom, though not the Messiah,
is spoken of in iv. and v., where the destruction of Israel’s
enemies is referred to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... But shortly thou shalt see his [i.e. the enemy’s] destruction,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shalt tread upon their necks (iv. 25, cf. verses 31 ff.).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The ingathering of Israel is also described:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They come gathered together from the east to the west,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rejoicing in the glory of God ... (iv. 36-v. 9).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The only other book which has teaching on this subject is
the important apocalypse 2 (4) Esdras, and here, as one
would expect, the teaching is full. The first point to notice
is that as this book is of composite authorship the conceptions
of the Messiah differ; thus, in the “Salathiel Apocalypse”
(iii.-x.) the Messiah is regarded as purely human:
“For my son the Messiah shall be revealed, together with
those who are with him, and shall rejoice the survivors four
hundred years. And it shall be, after these years, that my
son the Messiah shall die, and all in whom there is human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
breath” (vii. 28, 29). On the other hand, in the “Eagle
Vision” (xi.-xii. 39) the pre-existence of the Messiah is
taught, though he is to spring from the seed of David:
“This is the Messiah, whom the Most High hath kept unto
the end of the days, who shall spring from the seed of
David ...” (xii. 32). The same is taught in the “Vision
of the Man from the Sea” (xiii.): “Whereas thou
didst see a Man coming up from the heart of the sea—this
is he whom the Most High is keeping many ages ...”
(xiii. 25, 26). In this vision the Messiah is of a supernatural
character. This truth of the Messiah’s pre-existence is
likewise implied in the “Ezra Legend” (xiv.): “For thou
shalt be taken up from among men, and henceforth thou
shalt remain with my son, and with such as are like thee,
till the times be ended” (xiv. 9). Only in the “Salathiel
Apocalypse” are the signs which are to precede the Messianic
Kingdom (i.e. the “Messianic Woes”) mentioned,
but they are given in considerable detail: “Concerning
the signs, however—Behold the days come when the inhabitants
of the earth shall be seized with great panic,
and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land of faith
be barren. And iniquity shall be increased above that
which thou thyself now seest or that thou hast heard of
long ago. And the land that thou seest now to bear rule
shall be a pathless waste; and men shall see it forsaken;
if the Most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see it after
the third period in confusion. Then shall the sun suddenly
shine forth by night, and the moon by day; and blood
shall trickle from the wood, and the stone utter its voice.
The peoples shall be in commotion, the outgoings of the
stars shall change. And one whom the dwellers upon earth
do not look for shall wield sovereignty, and the birds shall
take to general flight, and the sea shall cast forth its fish.
And one whom the many do not know shall make his
voice heard by night; and all shall hear his voice. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
the earth o’er wide regions shall open, and the fire burst
forth for a long period. The wild beasts shall desert their
haunts, and women bear monsters. Salt waters shall
be found in the sweet. Friends shall attack one another
suddenly. Then shall intelligence hide itself, and Wisdom
withdraw to its chamber—by many shall be sought and
not found. And unrighteousness and incontinency shall
be multiplied upon the earth. One land shall also ask
another and say: Is righteousness—that doeth the right—passed
through thee? And it shall answer: No. And
it shall be that in that time men shall hope and not obtain,
shall labour and not prosper” (v. 1-12).</p>

<p>Regarding the Messianic Kingdom itself it is to be of
limited duration, and, according to the “Eagle Vision”
Gentiles as well as Jews are to enjoy it: “And so the
whole earth, freed from thy violence, shall be refreshed
again, and hope for the judgement and mercy of Him that
made her” (xi. 46).<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> In the “Vision of the Man from the
Sea” the Gentiles are wholly destroyed by the Messiah,
and his kingdom is only for his own people (xiii. 8-13).</p>

<p>In the Book of Wisdom there is no doctrine of the Messiah,
nor is there, in the Jewish Palestinian sense, a belief in a
Messianic Kingdom; what we do find, however, is that
Jewish traditional eschatological conceptions are utilized
by the author, and that a glorious future is believed to be
reserved for the Jews; there are two passages in which this
future is portrayed, viz. iii. 8:<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">They [i.e. the righteous] shall judge nations, and have dominion over peoples;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the Lord shall reign over them for evermore.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The thought that is apparently in the writer’s mind here
is that of such passages as Isaiah ii. 4<i>a</i>: “And He shall
judge among the nations, and shall decide concerning many
peoples,” and Isaiah xlix. 23: “And kings shall be thy
nursing-fathers and queens thy nursing-mothers; they
shall bow down to thee with their faces to the earth ...”;
these, it is true, refer to an earthly theocracy, whereas
the author of Wisdom is speaking of the hereafter, but the
<em>adaptation</em> of Scriptural passages is a very natural procedure;
he does not define closely the nature of the eternal
kingdom which will be set up hereafter, any more than the
prophet does in regard to his ideal earthly kingdom.
The other passage is v. 15-23:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">But the righteous live for ever,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And the Lord is their reward,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And the care for them with the Most High.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And a diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because with His right hand will He cover them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And with His arm will He shield them.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So far this passage, like the other one, is based upon Old
Testament Messianic passages such as Isaiah xl. 10, iv. 5, 6,
xxviii. 5, 6, lix. 16, 17, and others<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>;
but in verses 17-23<sup><i>ab</i></sup>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
where the Most High goes out Himself as a warrior, a different
element enters in. It is true, that here, too, the Old Testament
conception of Jehovah as a mighty man of war lies
at the back of the passage, but there are also other eschatological,
or rather apocalyptic, traits which appear. These
elements have been utilized by the author of Wisdom, who
has sought to spiritualize them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall take His jealousy as complete armour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shall make the whole creation His weapons for vengeance on His enemies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shall take judgement unfeigned as a helmet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall take holiness as an invincible shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shall sharpen stern wrath for a sword;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the world shall go forth with Him to fight against His insensate foes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shafts of lightning shall fly with true aim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the clouds, as from a well-drawn bow, shall they leap to the mark.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">So shall lawlessness make all the land desolate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And their evil-doing shall overturn the thrones of princes.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These two last lines are strikingly out of harmony with what
has preceded, since they deal with this world; such a sudden
change of subject is unnatural, the lines cannot originally
have stood here.</p>

<p>There is, thus, no doctrine of a Messiah or a Messianic
Kingdom in the ordinary Jewish sense; the kingdom which
is described has God as its ruler, it is an eternal kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
which only the righteous shall possess; the writer does
not make clear whether it is to be set up on this earth, or
whether it is to be a spiritual kingdom hereafter. From
the way in which he spiritualizes it is presumably to be a
kingdom in the world to come; against this it cannot be
urged that there are materialistic <em>traits</em> which point to a
kingdom to be set up on this earth, for the writer has clearly
borrowed and incorporated traditional eschatological
material without intending to utilize more than its outward
form. To interpret otherwise would, in view of the spirit
of the rest of this portion of the book, be to misunderstand
the author.</p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_f">(<i>f</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Future Life.</i></h4>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus the teaching on this subject is substantially
that of the normal Old Testament type; one or two
quotations will suffice to illustrate this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For what pleasure hath God in all that perish in Hades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In place of those who live and give Him praise?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead as from one that is not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But he that liveth and is in health praiseth the Lord (xvii. 27, 28).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The corruption of the body is looked upon as the end of
man:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When a man dieth he inheriteth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Worm and maggot, lice and creeping things (x. 11);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">though the annihilation of the spirit as well as the body is
evidently not contemplated in view of such words as these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Weep gently for the dead, for he hath found rest (xxii. 11);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in xxx. 17 death is spoken of as an “eternal rest”
(cp. xxxviii. 23, xlvi. 19). This idea of rest for the soul
hereafter is “very different from that of death being corruption
and the end of all things, which is the more usual one
in Ecclesiasticus, and one is perhaps justified in seeing the
beginnings of development here, based, it is true, on some
Old Testament passages; the conception of the dead resting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
must involve some sort of a belief beyond the bare existence
of the shade hereafter.”<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> It is of particular interest to
note that in one or two cases the Greek shows signs of some
development of conception regarding the future life where
in the Hebrew the normal Old Testament position is maintained;
thus in vii. 17 the Hebrew has:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Humble thy pride greatly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For the expectation of man is worms.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is rendered in the Greek:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Humble thy soul greatly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the punishment of the ungodly man is fire and the worm.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is clear that the development which is known to have
taken place in the doctrine of the future life during the
second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> is reflected here. Very noticeable is
the fact that a kind of technical sense has become attached
to the word “worm,” such as we find in Mark ix. 48
(“... where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched”). In xxi. 9, 10 it is probable that a similar
development exists, though in this case it cannot be proved
as the Hebrew is unfortunately not extant; but in view
of the example just given it is highly probable that the
following reading of the Greek likewise represents a
developed idea:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Like tow wrapped <ins class="corr" id="tn-289" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'together in the'">
together is the</ins> assembly of the ungodly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And their end is the flame of fire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The way of sinners is made smooth without stones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And at the end thereof is the pit of Hades.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that the parallelism between “the flame
of fire,” and “the pit of Hades,” suggests that the latter
has developed into Gehenna. Another example is to be
found in xlviii. 11, where the reference is to Elijah; only
one line of the original couplet is decipherable in the Hebrew,
viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Blessed is he that seeth thee and dieth;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">i.e. the man who before he died saw Elijah is blessed; the
next line is illegible in the Hebrew and corrupt in the Greek;
but the point of importance is that the Greek adds this
further line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And we also shall surely live,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the reference being evidently to the life hereafter, since Elijah
is the subject of the preceding couplet.</p>

<p>One other passage must be mentioned, not because in
itself it points to any development of thought, but because
the Old Testament episode (1 Kings xvii. 17-24) to which it
refers must sooner or later have suggested the thought of
the dead rising; it is also in reference to Elijah (xlviii.
5):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who didst raise up a dead man from death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And from Sheol, according to the good pleasure of Jehovah.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Hebrew and the Greek do not differ materially.</p>

<p>In the Book of Tobit the normal Old Testament doctrine
is taught; so, e.g., when Tobit prays: “Command my
spirit to be taken from me, that I may be released from off
the earth and become earth” (iii. 6); in the same verse
Sheol is spoken of as “the everlasting place,” it is a place
of “darkness” (iv. 10), and “below the earth” (xiii. 2).
In the Book of Judith there is only one reference to the
future life, but the passage is an important one as it witnesses
to a development of thought similar to that found in the
Greek text of Ecclesiasticus vii. 17, xxi. 9, 10, where Hades
is a place of punishment; the passage is xvi. 17—Judith
speaks as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Woe to the nations that rise up against my race;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgement,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To put fire and worms in their flesh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they shall weep and feel their pain for ever.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Here it is clear that the body is conceived of as suffering
anguish hereafter. Something similar to this is adumbrated
in the Prayer of Manasses, verse 12. It says here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... Neither, in Thy continual anger against me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Lay up evil in store for me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor pass Thou sentence against me</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When I am in the lowest parts of the earth.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the Pharisaic recension of Ecclesiasticus we may also
note one or two occurrences of development of doctrine;
thus after xix. 17 the following words are added:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of acceptance by Him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wisdom will gain love from Him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is life-giving instruction;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they who do the things that are pleasing unto Him shall pluck the fruit of the tree of immortality.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, reward hereafter for right doing in this life is taught
in the addition to xviii. 22:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the reward of God abideth to eternity.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Two instances of merely verbal additions point in the same
direction; in xxi. 10 the second addition in the ordinary
Greek text runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And at the end thereof is the pit of Hades;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">for “the pit of Hades” the Old Latin Version has: “the
lowest depth and darkness and punishment.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> One other
addition, this time of only a single word, witnesses to the
belief of the soul, not merely the shade of the departed,
existing in Sheol; this is in xlviii. 5, a passage already
referred to, where it speaks of Elijah raising a man from
death and from Sheol; the secondary Greek text adds
“his soul” after “Sheol.” These are, it is true, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
slight points, nevertheless they are worth mention as
supplementing what has already been said. The next
book which contains references to the doctrine of the future
life is 2 Maccabees, and here an immense development will
be seen to have taken place. We have to note first that
Hades is a place of punishment for the wicked, for in vi. 26
Eleazar, in refusing to commit the crime of offering idolatrous
sacrifice, says: “Even were I for the moment to
evade the punishment of men, I should not escape the
hands of the Almighty in life or in death.” For the righteous
Hades is only a temporary abode since the resurrection
is reserved for them; thus, the second son of the mother
whose seven sons are being martyred for their faith before
her face, when at the last gasp, says to the king: “Thou
cursed miscreant! Thou dost dispatch us from this life,
but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died
for His laws, and revive us to life everlasting” (vii. 9);
the same truth is taught in verses 23, 29 of the same chapter;
but the resurrection is not only that of the spirit,
but of the body also; in the account of the martyrdom of
the third son it says: “And when he was told to put out
his tongue, he did so at once, stretching forth his hands
courageously, with the noble words, These I had from
heaven; for His name’s sake I count them nought; from
Him I hope to get them back again” (vii. 10, 11; see also
xiv. 46). It is taught, further, that for the wicked there is
no resurrection, thus the fourth son speaks thus to the
king: “’Tis meet for those who perish at men’s hands to
cherish hope divine that they shall be raised up by God
again; but thou—thou shalt have no resurrection to life”
(vii. 14, so too in verse 36). The belief in the resurrection is
further illustrated by the following passage: “... In
this he acted quite rightly and properly, bearing in mind the
resurrection—for if he had not expected the fallen to rise
again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
for the dead—and having regard to the splendour of the
gracious reward which is reserved for those who have fallen
asleep in godliness; a holy and pious consideration” (xii.
43-45). It will thus be seen that we have in this book a
very advanced doctrine of the future life. In the Book
of Baruch two isolated references to the future life occur,
and here the teaching is the same as ordinarily found in
the Old Testament: “... the dead that are in the grave,
whose breath is taken from their bodies, will give unto the
Lord neither glory nor righteousness” (ii. 17, cp. iii. 19).</p>

<p>In 2 (4) Esdras there is an extraordinary wealth of material
regarding the future life; this is mostly confined to the “Salathiel
Apocalypse” portion and the Redactor’s additions—it
is therefore to these that we restrict ourselves. For
clearness’ sake it will be best to deal with the subject under
the three heads: (1) The Resurrection, (2) The Intermediate
state, (3) The Judgement; there are some subsidiary points
which will be touched upon incidentally.</p>

<p>(1) The doctrine of the <em>Resurrection</em> as taught in the
“Salathiel Apocalypse” is not altogether consistent; it
is not quite easy to understand how the writer conceived
of the resurrection, for it can scarcely have been the resurrection
of the body which he thought of since this is
regarded as altogether corruptible; thus, in speaking of
the future life of those who have kept the ways of the Most
High, he says that “they shall <ins class="corr" id="tn-293" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'be sepa  this'">
be separated from this</ins> corruptible
vessel” (vii. 88), and in <ins class="corr" id="tn-293a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the world to  me'">
the world to come</ins> “they rejoice that they have now escaped what is corruptible,
and that they shall inherit that which is to come” (vii.
96); that the body is meant by “what is corruptible”
is clear from verse 100, where the seer asks: “Shall time,
therefore, be given unto the souls after they are separated
from the bodies...?” Later in the book (ix. 36) it
is said again: “We who have received the Law and sinned
must perish, together with our heart, which has taken it in.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Added to this is the fact that this writer, unlike the Redactor
of the book (see below), never speaks of the resurrection
of the body, which one would rightly look for had
he believed in this; nor is there any mention of the soul
being re-united to the body; but he looks upon the body
as belonging wholly to this corruptible, material world;
he definitely contrasts the spiritual with the material, the
two are mutually antagonistic: “How should it be possible
for a mortal in a corruptible world to understand the ways
of the Incorruptible?” (iv. 11). Whereas in the world to come
“corruption is forgotten” (viii. 53). Yet, in spite of what
has been said, it would seem that the writer must have pictured
to himself a body of some kind in the world to come,
for in the Intermediate state (to which we shall refer presently)
he must, apparently, have believed in the existence
of bodies. The conclusion one is led to is this: the writer
believed that the material body became wholly annihilated
at death; but that the soul, when released from it, assumed
a non-material body in the Intermediate state, and that
this body did not undergo any further change at the Judgement;
it was non-material (it is difficult to know how else
to express it; “spiritual” does not seem the right word to
use in view of what is said about the body in the Intermediate
state)—it was non-material, and therefore incorruptible,
immortal; and for this reason no further
change could take place in it at the final Judgement, for it
would then be fit for the new world to be created (cp. vii.
75). One is, therefore, led to assume that the resurrection
takes place almost immediately after death, i.e. at the
end of the seven days of “freedom,” or “rest,” which,
according to vii. 101, intervene between the end of this life
and the beginning of the Intermediate state, and therefore
before the Judgement. As to whether the wicked, as well
as the righteous, rise one cannot speak with certainty, the
implication seems to be that this is not so, but no definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
pronouncement is made on this point; cp. the following
words which are put into the mouth of God: “For, indeed,
I will not concern myself about the creation of those who
have sinned, or their death, judgement, or perdition; but
I will rejoice rather over the creation of the righteous,
over their pilgrimage also, and their salvation, and their
recompense” (viii. 38, 39).</p>

<p>(2) Regarding the <em>Intermediate state</em>, minute details are
given, but the main points are these; in vii. 78-87 the
lot of the wicked is thus described: “When the decisive
decree has gone forth from the Most High that the man
should die, as the soul from the body departs, that it may
return to Him Who gave it, to adore the glory of the Most
High first of all;—if it be one of those that have scorned,
and have not kept, the ways of the Most High, and have
despised His Law, and that hate those who fear God, such
souls shall not enter into habitations, but shall wander
about henceforth in torture, ever grieving and sad, in
seven ways.” These ways are then described. On the
other hand the lot of the righteous is as follows: “Of
those, however, who have kept the ways of the Most High
this is the order, when they shall be separated from this
vessel of mortality.... First of all they shall see with
great joy the glory of Him Who receives them; and they
shall rest in seven orders ...”; these orders are then
described; of the seventh it is said that it “exceeds all
the aforesaid; they shall rejoice with boldness, be confident
without confusion, be glad without fear; for they are hastening
to behold the face of Him Whom in life they served,
and from Whom they are destined to receive their reward
in glory. This is the order of the souls of the righteous
...” (vii. 88-99). As to the duration of this Intermediate
state we are given no details.</p>

<p>(3) At the close of the Intermediate state comes the
<em>Judgement</em>; but here again there is some ambiguity, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
from vii. 113, 114 we learn that “the Day of Judgement
shall be the end of this age and the beginning of the eternal
age that is to come, wherein corruption is passed away,
weakness is abolished ...”; but this is inconsistent
with the idea that corruption passes away with death
(vii. 88), i.e. that the Intermediate state is the beginning
of the age to come. Does the writer conceive of the new
age, the age of incorruption and eternity, as beginning
immediately after death, or at the Judgement? If the
former, then it agrees with what he, presumably, believes
regarding the resurrection which likewise takes place immediately
after death; but if the latter, then the Intermediate
state is left out of reckoning. In either case the teaching is
inconsistent; evidently the writer’s own mind is not clear
on the subject. Upon other points there is, however, no
want of definiteness; thus, what the righteous and the
wicked have respectively experienced in the Intermediate
state is only a foretaste of what will be enormously increased
at the Judgement, for the righteous their happiness, for the
wicked their torment. The writer is very strong in insisting
that on the Day of Judgement no intercession of the righteous
will avail on behalf of the wicked. The seer asks “whether
in the Day of Judgement the righteous shall be able to
intercede for the ungodly, or to intreat the Most High in
their behalf ...”; and the reply is: “... so shall
none then pray for another on that Day, neither shall one
lay a burden on another; for then every one shall bear
his own righteousness or unrighteousness ...” (vii. 102-115).</p>

<p>In the other parts of this book these subjects are only
slightly dealt with; but there is some important teaching
in those portions which have probably been added by the
Redactor.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> He believes in a general resurrection (at any
rate he makes no distinction between good and bad) of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
the body, and though he does not specifically mention
the Intermediate state he evidently holds the same belief
regarding this as the original writer: “The earth shall
restore those that sleep in her, and the dust those that are
at rest therein; and the chambers shall restore the souls
that were committed unto them” (vii. 32). Here there is
thus a clear reference to the re-union of soul and body,
but the time at which this takes place is at the beginning
of a new age which will begin seven days after the close
of the Messianic Age. The Redactor, in seeking to combine
the eschatology of the individual with that of the nation,
presents the course of the final events in a different way,
thus: “For, behold, days come—and it shall be when
the signs which I have foretold unto thee [i.e. the Messianic
Woes] shall come to pass—then shall the city that is now
invisible [i.e. the heavenly Jerusalem] appear, and the
land which is now concealed [i.e. the heavenly Paradise]
be seen. And whosoever is delivered from the predicted
evil, the same shall see My wonders. For My Son, the
Messiah, shall be revealed, together with those who are with
Him, and shall rejoice the survivors four hundred years.
And it shall be, after these years, that My Son the Messiah
shall die, and all in whom there is human breath. Then
shall the world be turned into the primæval silence seven
days, like as in the first beginnings, so that no man is left.
And it shall be after seven days that the Age which is not
yet awake, shall be roused, and that which is corruptible
shall perish” (vii. 26-31); then follows the passage about
the resurrection quoted above, and it continues (verses
33 ff.): “And the Most High shall be revealed upon the
throne of judgement; and then cometh the end....
And recompense shall follow, and the reward be made
manifest; deeds of righteousness shall awake, and deeds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
iniquity shall not sleep. And then shall the pit of torment
appear; and over against it the place of refreshment.
The furnace of Gehenna shall be made manifest, and
over against it the Paradise of delight. And then the Most
High shall say to the nations that have been raised (from
the dead): Look now, and consider Whom ye have denied,
Whom ye have not served, Whose commandments ye have
despised! Look, now, before you: here delight and
refreshment, there fire and torments....” Here, then,
we have an eschatological scheme quite different from that
of the “Salathiel Apocalypse”; the Messianic Age is
preceded by the signs, or woes; then the Messiah is revealed
and His kingdom lasts four hundred years; at the
end of this period all flesh, including the Messiah, dies, and
the world is plunged in primæval silence for seven days;
then comes the Resurrection, a bodily resurrection, in
which all men, Gentile and Jew, ungodly and godly, partake;
this is immediately followed by the Judgement
which ushers in the New Age.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Book of Wisdom we note that there
is no resurrection of body taught here; this follows naturally
from the writer’s doctrine of the inherent evil of matter.
The only immortality is that of the soul, and this is gained
through “kinship unto wisdom”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When I considered these things in myself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And took thought in my heart how that in kinship unto wisdom is immortality,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in her friendship is good delight....</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I went about seeking how to take her unto myself (viii. 17, 18);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">so that immortality begins on this earth. The Judgement
takes place immediately after death; the writer describes
fully the lot in the future life reserved respectively for the
righteous and the ungodly; in the beautiful and well-known
passage (iii. 1-9) the blessedness of the righteous is described
in this way:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the souls of the righteous are in the hands of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And no torment shall touch them ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But they are in peace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For though in the sight of men they be punished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their hope is full of immortality ... (iii. 1-9).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of the ungodly it is said, on the other hand:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the ungodly shall be requited even as they reasoned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They which lightly regarded the righteous man, and revolted from the Lord ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And void is their hope, and their toils unprofitable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And useless are their works ... (iii. 10 ff.).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again in chapter v. the contrast hereafter between the
righteous and the unrighteous is told in the following
way:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the righteous shall live for ever,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the Lord is their reward,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the care for them with the Most High.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand ... (v. 15 ff.);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but the ungodly, on seeing the blessedness of the righteous,
will be greatly troubled:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When they see it they shall be troubled with terrible fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shall be amazed at the marvel of His salvation ...</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Bitter remorse takes hold of them as they review their
former godless life and see that they have now no further
hope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because the hope of the ungodly is like chaff carried off by the wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent46">(see v. 1-14).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in regard to the Judgement the writer of Wisdom is not
consistent, for in iii. 8 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">They [i.e. the righteous] shall judge nations, and have dominion over peoples;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Lord shall reign over them for evermore.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On the other hand, in v. 17-23, there is an entirely different
eschatological conception:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He [i.e. Jehovah] shall take His jealousy as complete armour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And shall make the whole creation His weapons of vengeance on His enemies ...;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">this is all described with great vividness in the verses which
follow. It seems as though the author were acquainted
with more than one Jewish eschatological scheme, and
utilized them, but without realizing that they were inconsistent
with each other. See further above, <a href="#PI_CHXII_e">section (<i>e</i></a>),
on the doctrine of the Messiah. According to this book,
then, there is no Intermediate state; if one can speak of a
Resurrection at all it is only in reference to the soul; as
the soul is immortal both the righteous and the ungodly live
hereafter; the righteous in bliss the ungodly in torment
of a purely spiritual kind (see iv. 19, v. 2, xvii. 21); it is
not said where the scene of the Judgement is. The writer,
it will thus be seen, departs widely from Palestinian
Jewish belief on this subject, but he is not ignorant of it;
though a Jew, his Hellenistic caste of mind makes it impossible
for him to accept the Jewish position.</p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_g">(<i>g</i>) <i>The Doctrine of Angels.</i></h4>

<p>The nature of the contents of Ecclesiasticus is such that
one does not look for much reference to angels; nevertheless,
in two passages there is a distinct mention of them,
viz. xlii. 16 (17):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">God’s holy ones have not the power</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To recount His wondrous works of might;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though God hath given strength to His hosts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To endure in the presence of His glory (so the Hebrew).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The meaning of the passage is that even the “holy ones”
(i.e. angels, as in Deut. xxxiii. 1. [but see Driver’s
<cite>Deuteronomy</cite>, p. 392], Job v. 1, Ps. lxxxix. 7, and often
in the apocalyptic books) are unable to recount God’s
marvellous works though, by means of special strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
given to them, they stand in His very presence. The other
passage is xliii. 26:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Through Him His angel prospereth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And at His word what He wills is done.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Hebrew text here is a little uncertain, but that a
reference to angels is intended is probable because the whole
passage of which this is the concluding verse is based upon
Psalm civ. 1 ff., verse 4 of which runs: “Who maketh His
angels of the winds, His ministers of the flaming fire.” In
the Book of Tobit the angel Raphael<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> plays an important
part; in xii. 15 he says of himself: “I am Raphael, one
of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the
saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One” (cp.
also verse 12). This angel is sent from God, according to
iii. 7, to heal Tobit’s blindness, and to bring about the
marriage between Tobit’s son Tobias and Sarah, the daughter
of Raguel, by binding Asmodeus the evil spirit (cp. vi.
10-17). He accompanies Tobias on his journey to Media,
and thus appears as a guardian angel. The angelic host
is referred to in viii. 15: “Blessed art Thou, O God, with
all pure and holy blessing; and let Thy saints bless Thee,
and all Thy creatures; and let all Thine angels and elect
bless Thee for ever.” There is no mention of angels in the
Book of Judith; but in the Additions to Daniel there are
several references; thus in the “Prayer of Azariah,” verses
26, 27, it is said: “But the angel of the Lord came down
into the furnace together with Azariah and his fellows, and
he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace, and made
the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling
wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt
nor troubled them.” In “Susanna,” again, the activity
of angels is referred to in verses 44, 45 (Septuagint Version),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
where the angel of the Lord is said to have bestowed “a
spirit of discernment” upon Daniel; also in verse 55
(Septuagint Version), where the angel of the Lord is about
to “cleave the soul” of one of the criminals brought before
Daniel; and, once more, it is an angel who carries out the
sentence against the two elders: “Then the angel of the
Lord cast fire in the midst of them” (verse 62). In Theodotion’s
Version the angel of the Lord is referred to in verses
55, 59, and is spoken of in each case as the avenging angel.
Then, again, in “Bel and the Dragon,” verses 34-39, there
is the curious story of how the angel of the Lord took up the
prophet Habakkuk by the hair and transported him from
Judah to Babylon in order that he might give food to Daniel
in the lion’s den. In the Prayer of Manasses the angelic
host is spoken of in verse 15: “For all the host of heaven
doth sing Thy praise.” In the Epistle of Jeremy, verse 7,
a guardian angel is spoken of as being with the captives in
Babylon. The belief in angels is incidentally referred to in
the Additions to Esther (Fourth Addition, xv. 13 in R.V.),
where Esther compares the king to an angel of God. A
somewhat fantastic representation of the activity of angels
is given in three passages in 2 Maccabees; in iii. 24 ff. there
is an account of how the attempt of Seleucus and Heliodorus
to take the temple at Jerusalem was frustrated; on their
reaching the treasury “the Sovereign of spirits and all
authority prepared a great apparition, so that all who had
presumed to enter were stricken with dismay at the power
of God, and fainted with sheer terror. For there appeared
to them a horse with a terrible rider, and it was decked in
magnificent trappings, and rushing fiercely forward it
struck at Heliodorus with its forefeet. And the rider seemed
to be armed with a golden panoply. Two youths also
appeared before Heliodorus, remarkable for their strength,
gloriously handsome, and splendidly arrayed, who stood
by him on either side, and scourged him unceasingly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
inflicting on him many sore stripes....” Again, in xi.
6-10, God is besought “to send a good angel to save Israel”;
the prayer is heard, and “a rider appeared at their head,
in white apparel, brandishing weapons of gold”; owing to
his help the Israelites win the battle. Lastly, in xv. 11-16
belief in angels seems to be connected with dreams; for
Maccabæus recounts the following “reliable dream,” which
has the effect of greatly encouraging the people: “Onias,
the former high-priest, a good and great man, of stately
bearing yet gracious in manner, well-spoken, and trained
from childhood in all points of virtue—Onias, with out-stretched
hands, invoking blessings on the whole body of the
Jews; then another man in the same attitude, conspicuous
by his grey hairs and splendour, and invested with marvellous,
majestic dignity. This, Onias explained to him, is the
lover of the brethren, for he prayeth fervently for the people
and the holy city, Jeremiah the prophet of God. And
Jeremiah held out his right hand to present Judas with a
golden sword, and as he gave it he addressed him thus:
Take this holy sword as a gift from God, and with it thou
shalt crush the foe.” No other books refer to angels until
we come to 2 (4) Esdras.</p>

<p>A greatly developed angelology appears in the “Salathiel
Apocalypse”; we must content ourselves here with an outline
of this only. At the head of the angelic host stand seven
archangels; of these only two are mentioned in this book,
viz. Jeremiel, who guards the souls of the righteous in the
chambers where they are awaiting the final judgement and
resurrection (iv. 33-37)<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>; and Uriel, who is sent to the seer
in order to show him the inscrutability of God’s ways
(iv. 1-11). Elsewhere angels are referred to as speaking in
the name of God, e.g. vii. 130; they are instant in fulfilling
God’s commands, whatsoever these may be:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Before Whom heaven’s hosts stand trembling.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And at Thy word change to wind and fire (viii. 21);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and their power is much restricted: “As for me, I am
unwise and powerless; how then should I essay to speak
of these things of which thou questionest me?” (v. 39).
Throughout this apocalypse it is by angelic agency that
God communicates with the seer.</p>

<p>In the Book of Wisdom the point of interest is that the
place of angels is taken by Wisdom, or by the Word, the
development of doctrine having eliminated angelology
altogether; thus, in x. 17, 18 it is said of Wisdom that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">She rendered unto holy men a reward of their toils;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She guided them along a marvellous way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And became unto them a covering in the daytime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a light of stars through the night....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here Wisdom has taken the place of the “angel of God”
in Exodus xiv. 19. Again, in xviii. 15, 16 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine all-powerful Word leaped from heaven down from the royal throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A stern warrior, into the midst of the doomed land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bearing as a sharp sword thine unfeigned commandment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And standing, filled all things with death;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while it touched the heaven it trode upon the earth.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here the Logos has taken the place of the avenging angel,
for it is evident that the writer had 1 Chronicles xxi. 15, 16
in his mind: “... And David lifted up his eyes, and saw
the angel of the Lord stand between the earth and the heaven,
having a drawn sword in his hand.” This allegorizing is
what one would naturally look for in Wisdom.</p>


<h4 class="left" id="PI_CHXII_h">(<i>h</i>) <i>Demonology.</i></h4>

<p>It is doubtful whether there is any reference to demons
in Ecclesiasticus; possibly, however, xxxix. 28-31 contains
such a reference.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> In Tobit iii. 8 mention is made of Asmodeus,
“the evil demon,” who slays men; the angel, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
has power to “unbind” him from people (iii. 17, viii. 3),
though apparently the most efficacious way of getting rid
of him is by burning the liver and heart of a fish on incense
which drives the demon away (vi. 17, viii. 3). The only other
reference to demons is in Baruch iv. 35, where it is said that
they are to inhabit the desolate city “for a great time.”
It is worth pointing out, finally, that in the Book of Wisdom,
while there is no demonology in the ordinary sense, there
is a belief in the devil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But by the envy of the devil death entered into the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they that belong to his realm experience it (ii. 24).</div>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Regarding the importance for the study of the New Testament
of the doctrines which have been considered see the
respective sections of the different introductions to the
books of the Apocrypha in Part II.</p>


<h4 id="PI_CHXII_SUM"><span class="smcap">Summary</span></h4>

<p>The books of the Apocrypha contain only part of the
doctrinal teaching of the literature from which they have
been, quite arbitrarily, distinguished. It is not possible
here to consider all the works which must be consulted for
a complete study of the period with which we are dealing,
but in restricting ourselves to the Apocrypha there is this
compensation, that the more important of its books were
recognized by official Judaism as containing good orthodox
teaching, so that they supply a useful foundation for further
study of the development of doctrine. In some cases,
however, recourse must be had to the Apocalyptic Literature,
for though the books of the Apocrypha afford a general
criterion as to orthodox Jewish teaching from 200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
to <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 100, they are in some respects inadequate.</p>

<p>It must again be emphasized that the Old Testament is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
not the sole background of the Apocryphal books in the
domain of doctrine: there have been marked Persian and
Greek influences in certain directions. The main current of
Palestinian Judaism was affected by these, while the Judaism
of the Dispersion in its turn was influenced by both Persian
and Greek thought, and the effect of all this is traceable in the
Apocrypha. The teaching of the various books must also
be followed in chronological order; there are differences
of opinion as to actual dates, but there is approximate
unanimity as to the centuries to which the books, in almost
all cases, belong. In some instances different parts of a
book belong to different times, as will be seen from the
Chronological Table (p. 320). For discussions of the dates,
see the Introductions in Part II.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Wisdom was considered in <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>;
here we have to deal with the doctrines of God, of the Law,
of Sin, of Grace and Free-will, of the Messiah, of the Future
Life, of Angels, and with Demonology; these cannot always
be kept separate, as one leads into another. Only cursory
mention will be made of those points where the teaching is
identical with that of the Old Testament, though even in
these cases the characteristic form in which a doctrine is
exhibited will be noted, the main object is to show in what
respects the books of the Apocrypha show an advance, or
it may be a retrogression, in doctrine as compared with the
Old Testament.</p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The Doctrine of God.</i></p>

<p>Ecclesiasticus treats of the Unity of God, the Creator
of all; His eternity and omnipotence, His activity in nature,
His wisdom, holiness, justice, loving-kindness, and mercy,
His fatherhood of Israel and sometimes of all flesh (see
xlii. 15-xliii. 33). Here the inspiration is drawn largely
from the Psalms, but in xlii. 16, and xliii. 28-32, Ben-Sira
seems to go beyond anything to be found in the Old Testament.
No book of the Apocrypha has such a variety of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
names for God as Tobit, which is also distinguished by a
doctrine of angelic mediation and a universalistic spirit
which is in marked contrast to Judith. In the Prayer of
Manasses great stress is laid on the Divine compassion. In
the secondary text of Ecclesiasticus, which is a Pharisaic
recension of the work, the great characteristic is that
religious individualism which did so much to foster spiritual
worship. The heightened expression of the close relationship
between God and His pious ones which the more ardent
religious temperament of the Pharisees demanded can be
illustrated by a comparison of i. 12, and xvii. 20, with the
lines which immediately follow in either instance. This
spirit reappears in the Psalms of Solomon.</p>

<p>In the original text of 1 Maccabees all mention of the
name of God is deliberately avoided; once or twice, as
in iii. 18, a true faith in the omnipotence of God is expressed,
and not infrequently there is trust in God as the God of
Israel Who will help His people against their foes. In all
three of the documents which make up Baruch, stress is
laid on God’s guidance of Israel’s destiny, and in the portion,
iv. 5-v. 9, the Divine compassion is constantly recalled.
2 (4) Esdras represents the best of the Old Testament teaching
concerning the doctrine of God: the Unity of God, His
Creatorship without any mediatorial agency, Israel as the
chosen nation with which God has entered into a covenant
relation, are all insisted upon by the writer, whose faith in
God, and conviction that His love is for His people, remains,
though he is presented with problems which are insoluble
for man. In the Book of Wisdom the religious atmosphere
is to a large extent alien to that of Palestine: the presentment
of the doctrine of God is entirely different in its two
parts, whether these are by two different authors or by one
writing at different times in his life. The first part (ii.-xi. 1)
is more Greek than Jewish, the idea of God is that of Greek
philosophy: a transcendent God Who has no immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
contact with the world, but performs His will through an
intermediary, who is Wisdom. In the second part God is
again and again spoken of as interfering personally in
mundane affairs, and in other respects also the Old Testament
doctrine is represented, as in the need of right worship,
and the mercy and justice of God.</p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Law.</i></p>

<p>The stress laid in Ecclesiasticus on the importance of the
Law, from both ethical and ritual points of view, shows
this work to be a valuable link between the Judaism of
post-exilic times and Rabbinical Judaism. The Law is eternal
and divine, and its pre-existence is implied in its identification
with Wisdom. So far as is known this identification
occurs here for the first time, but the way it is taken for
granted shows that it cannot have been wholly new. The
insistence on the need of observing the Law is characteristic
of this book, as is the teaching on the spirit in which the
precepts are to be carried out. In chapter xxiv. 7 ff. the
Law is only for Israel. In Tobit an earnest zeal for the
Law is combined with deep devotion. This book indicates
a development of legal observances; prayer, almsgiving
and fasting are strongly advocated, particularly almsgiving.
The laws of tithe, marriage, honour to parents, keeping
the feasts, purifications and others are inculcated. This
love for the Law, combined with worship, offers a fine illustration
of the truly pious Jew at this period. The teaching
concerning the Law in Judith is strongly Pharisaic; while
everything depends upon trust in God and obedience to
Him, both are shown by keeping the Law; only the practical
observance is taught; there is no abstract conception.
The observance of Sabbaths, new moons and feasts is
emphasized. Reference is made to the sacrificial system
and the gifts of the people, and in the poem xvi. 2-17 the
right spirit in offering is the really important matter. In
1 Maccabees there is reflected the earnest zeal for the Law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
on the part of the patriots. In 2 Maccabees much stress
is laid upon legal observances, and the whole attitude towards
the Law is that of the Pharisaic school of about the
first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> onwards. This also applies to 1 (3) Esdras.</p>

<p>In the document Baruch iii. 9-iv. 4, where the Law and
Wisdom are identified, exiled Israel is told that the reason
of his punishment is the forsaking of the commandments
of life, i.e. the Law. The Law endures for ever, and is apparently
for Israel alone. Of the different portions which
make up 2 (4) Esdras the most important in the present
connection is the “Salathiel Apocalypse,” which forms the
bulk of the book (iii.-x.) Here it is said, in accordance with
later Rabbinical teaching, that the Law had originally
been given to other nations, by whom it was rejected, while
Israel alone had accepted it. In the other portions of the
book the main stress is laid on veneration for the Law. In
the Book of Wisdom there is very little on the subject to be
noted, but the foreign rulers are denounced for not keeping
the Law.</p>


<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Doctrine of Sin.</i></p>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus the prevalence of Sin in one and all is often
noted, and there is much said about its origin. Here Ben-Sira
finds a problem too difficult for him. He implies, though
he hardly goes so far as to make the definite assertion, that
the origin of sin is due to God (xxxiii. 13-15), but in one
important passage he strongly combats this (xv. 11-13). He
traces it back to the fall of Eve, but no farther. He speaks
sometimes of Sin as originating within man, sometimes as
being external to him. Like the later Rabbis, he becomes
involved in inconsistencies as soon as he tries to construct
a working theory on the subject. In his teaching on the
atonement for sins he shows a great advance on the Old
Testament, adding almsgiving and fasting as means of
atonement, and foreshadowing the idea that Death also
may be one. This last idea became of ever-increasing importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
with the growth in later Judaism of the belief in
the resurrection. There is little that calls for notice in
Tobit except a reference to the atoning efficacy of almsgiving;
and nothing in Judith, or the Additions to Daniel; but in
the Prayer of Manasses we find the thought that the Patriarchs
were sinless—an idea developed in the later Rabbinical
Literature in connection with the “Treasury of Merit”
of the Fathers—and a deeper realization of sin than is to be
found in any other book of the Apocrypha. In 2 Maccabees
there is a strangely particularistic doctrine of retribution
for Sin. The teaching in 1 (3) Esdras and Baruch is that
of the Old Testament, but the doctrine as to the merits of
the Fathers is expressly repudiated in Baruch. 2 (4)
Esdras is important; especially, again, the Salathiel Apocalypse.
Here the origin of sin is traced to Adam, though
its connection with him is not explained; but Sin is regarded
as universal, each man clothing himself with the evil
heart. In the Book of Wisdom there is a belief in an original
state of good, which is so decidedly contradicted by a later
passage (xii. 10, 11) as to emphasize belief in a different
authorship for the two parts of the book: on this point, as
on the subject of Death, it is the first part that is important
for us, the second offers nothing new.</p>


<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The Doctrine of Grace and Free-will.</i></p>

<p>A true balance between these two is kept in Ecclesiasticus;
they are shown as complementary, not contradictory, thus
continuing the teaching of the Old Testament concerning the
omnipotence of God and the responsibility of man. Similar
teaching is found in Tobit. The rest of the books belonging
to this century have nothing that calls for particular notice,
but in the secondary text of Ecclesiasticus the same balance
is found as in the first. In 1 Maccabees much more emphasis
is laid on Free-will than on Grace, owing to a growing
disinclination to ascribe action among men directly to God,
because of His inexpressible majesty. In the Additions to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
Esther, on the contrary, there is throughout insistence on
the Divine activity, while human free-will is scarcely taken
into account; there can be no doubt that the one-sided
emphasis in either case was prompted by the particular
subject-matter of the book. In 1 Maccabees there is very
little to note under the present heading, though stress is
frequently laid upon the idea that the Jews are under special
protection and guidance. In 2 (4) Esdras it is again only
the Salathiel Apocalypse that claims attention; here the
writer is driven by his deep sense of sinfulness and his
conviction of man’s inability to acquire justification by the
works of the Law, to look to Divine Grace where human
will-power was helpless. In the Book of Wisdom the main
emphasis is on Free-will, though the other side of the truth
is not left out of sight.</p>


<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Messiah.</i></p>

<p>The didactic character of Ecclesiasticus accounts for the
meagre reference to this doctrine; there is belief in a Messiah
who is to be purely human and of the House of David, but
it is vague in the extreme. The conceptions of a Messiah
were largely regulated by the historical circumstances of
any given period, and during the time of Ben-Sira these
were not of a nature to call forth Messianic hopes. In Tobit
the Messiah is never mentioned, but the renovated Jerusalem
and the ingathering of the dispersed Israelites, and also of the
Gentiles, give a picture of what corresponds to the Messianic
Kingdom. No other books offer teaching on the subject
until we come to 1 Maccabees, where “a prophet” is looked
for; in one passage he is to be of Hasmonæan lineage. In
2 Maccabees there is no reference to the Messiah, though
there is to the Messianic Kingdom. The only other book is
the important apocalypse 2 (4) Esdras, and here the teaching
is full, and, as the book is of composite authorship, various.
In the Salathiel Apocalypse (iii.-x.), the Messiah is regarded
as purely human, and only in this portion are the signs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
which are to precede the Messianic Kingdom mentioned.
In the eagle vision (xi.-xii. 29), and the vision of the man
rising from the sea (xiii.), and in the Ezra legend (xiv.), the
pre-existence of the Messiah is taught. The Messianic
Kingdom itself is to be of limited duration, and, in the
eagle vision, Gentiles as well as Jews are to enjoy it, but
in the vision of the man from the sea the Gentiles are to
be wholly destroyed by the Messiah, and His kingdom is
only for His own people. In the Book of Wisdom there is
no doctrine of the Messiah, nor is there a belief in a Messianic
Kingdom in the Jewish Palestinian sense, but the traditional
Jewish eschatological conceptions are utilized by the author
and a glorious future is believed to be reserved for the Jews.</p>


<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The Doctrine of the Future Life.</i></p>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus the teaching on this subject is substantially
of the normal Old Testament type; the corruption
of the body is looked upon as the end of man, though
the annihilation of the spirit as well is evidently not
contemplated.</p>

<p>Once or twice death is spoken of as a rest. The development
in this doctrine which is known to have taken place
during the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> is reflected by some additions.
It is of particular interest to note that in one or two cases the
Greek shows signs of some development of conception where
in the Hebrew the normal Old Testament position is maintained.
It is very noticeable that a kind of technical sense
has become attached to the word “worm,” as in Mark ix.
48. In Tobit the normal Old Testament doctrine is taught.
In Judith the only reference is an important one, as it witnesses
to a development of the thought of Hades as a place
of punishment. There is something similar to this in the
Prayer of Manasses. In the Pharisaic recension of Ecclesiasticus
words added here and there show a development
of thought as to the Future Life. The next book which
contains references to this is 2 Maccabees, and here an immense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
development has taken place; Hades is a place of
punishment for the wicked; but only a temporary abode
for the righteous, since the Resurrection is reserved for
them; and the Resurrection is not only of the spirit, but
of the body also. For the wicked there is no resurrection.
In Baruch there are two isolated references; and in both
the teaching is that ordinarily found in the Old Testament.
In 2 (4) Esdras there is an extraordinary wealth of material,
mostly confined to the Salathiel Apocalypse. Here the
doctrine of the resurrection is not altogether consistent, and
the writer’s thought is not quite easy to understand; he
seems to have believed that the material body became
wholly annihilated at death, but the soul, when released
from it, assumed a non-material body in the Intermediate
state, and that this, being incorruptible, did not undergo
any further change at the Judgement. The Resurrection
apparently takes place immediately after death. It is
uncertain whether the wicked rise as well as the righteous.
Minute details are given as to the lot of the wicked and
that of the righteous in the Intermediate state, but none as
to the duration of this. At its close comes the Judgement.
Here there is the same ambiguity; the writer’s mind is
not clear whether the age of incorruption and eternity is
to begin immediately after death, or only at the Judgement.
But there is no want of definiteness as to the happiness
of the righteous and the torment of the wicked; both will
be enormously increased at the Judgement, and then no
intercession of the righteous for the wicked will avail.
In those portions of the book which have probably been
added by the Redactor there is some important teaching as
to a general resurrection, and a re-union of soul and body,
which is to take place at the beginning of a new age seven
days after the close of the Messianic Age. This is part of
a new eschatological scheme, quite different from that
of the Salathiel Apocalypse, and seeking to combine the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
eschatology of the individual with that of the nation. In
the Book of Wisdom there is no resurrection of the body; the
only immortality is that of the soul, and it begins on this
earth. Judgement takes place immediately after death, and
there is no Intermediate state. The bliss of the righteous
and the torment of the ungodly are of a purely spiritual
kind. It seems as though the author were acquainted
with more than one Jewish eschatological scheme, and
used them without recognizing their inconsistency. He
says nothing as to where the scene of the Judgement will
be laid; he is not ignorant of the Palestinian Jewish belief,
but, being of an Hellenic cast of mind, he cannot accept it.</p>


<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>The Doctrine of Angels.</i></p>

<p>In Ecclesiasticus there are but few references; in xlii. 16
the “holy ones” are unable to recount God’s marvellous
works, though strength is given them to stand in His presence.
In Tobit the angel Raphael plays an important part; he
binds Asmodeus, and appears as guardian angel to Tobit
on his journey. The angelic host is referred to in viii. 15.
There is no mention of angels in Judith, but in the Additions
to Daniel the angel of the Lord appears in each of the stories.
The angelic host is spoken of in the Prayer of Manasses, and
a guardian angel in the Epistle of Jeremy, and there is an
incidental reference to angels in the Additions to Esther.
A somewhat fantastic representation of the activity of
angels is given in 2 Maccabees in the stories of Heliodorus
and of the rider leading Israel to battle and of the “reliable
dreams” of Maccabæus. No other books refer to angels
till we come to 2 (4) Esdras, and here in the Salathiel
Apocalypse a greatly developed angelology appears. At
the head of the angelic host stand seven archangels, and
God communicates with the seer by means of the angels.
In the Book of Wisdom the place of these is taken by the
Word or by Wisdom, the development of doctrine having
here eliminated angelology altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>


<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Demonology.</i></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether there is any reference to demons in
Ecclesiasticus; there may be one in xxxix. 18-31. In Tobit
there is an evil demon who slays men. The only other
reference is in Baruch; but in the Book of Wisdom, though
there is no demonology in the ordinary sense, there is a
belief in the devil.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">We come now to deal with the books of the Apocrypha.
As far as possible we shall take these in chronological
order, though it will be recognized that certitude in this
matter is not to be expected. There are different opinions
regarding the dates of most of the books, and in some cases
the <em>data</em> for coming to a conclusion are too scanty to allow
of anything approaching confidence in the correctness of the
date assigned. Moreover, as to some of the books, different
parts belong to different periods; this can be proved even
though one cannot be sure of the exact date of each part.
Then there is the further difficulty regarding the question as
to whether a particular book, as we now have it, approximates
to its original form, and if there is reason to believe
that this is not the case, as to the date of the original as well
as that of its present form.</p>

<p>The plan here followed is to take the books in the order
of the dates of their original form (as far as this can be
ascertained), even though parts of a book belong to a later
date, which will, of course, be notified. It will also be wiser
to assign a period rather than a fixed date, excepting in the
one case, that of Ecclesiasticus, where the date of the original
can be fixed to within a decade or so with reasonable certainty.
The books belonging to a particular period are
put in chronological order within that period. The following

<h4 id="PII_CHI_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Title of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">“Ecclesiasticus,” the name with which we are
most familiar, gives no indication as to the contents
of the book; it has, however, been the title whereby the
book was known in the Western Church ever since the third
century. St. Jerome retained the familiar title in his Latin
Version of the Bible, and it has continued in the Church
ever since. On account of its manifold instruction in conduct
of life it was much used in the early Church, especially
in the case of catechumens; the title, therefore, of “Ecclesiasticus”
was probably given to it because it was the
ecclesiastical or Church book <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. What the
original title was we do not know; but in most manuscripts
of the Greek Version the title given is: “Wisdom of Jesus
the son of Sirach”; in the Syriac Version it is: “Wisdom
of Bar Sira.”<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Both these were translations from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
Hebrew, so that we shall not be far wrong in believing that
the original title ran: “The Wisdom of Ben-Sira,” or,
“The Wisdom of Jesus Ben-Sira.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The Greek translator,
in the Prologue to the book, speaks of his grandfather
“Jesus” as the author. In the Talmud the book is referred
to as: “The Book of Ben-Sira”; the name “Jesus”
would have been omitted by the Rabbis for obvious reasons.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Author and his Book</span></h4>

<p>In the Prologue to the Greek Version the writer says that
he is about to translate his grandfather’s work; in the
Hebrew text the author gives his name, as we have seen;
this is also given in the subscription; moreover, in the
Talmud the author is given as Ben-Sira. There is, therefore,
every reason to believe that the author was Ben-Sira;
and this is universally acknowledged. That he wrote the
whole of the book does not admit of doubt; unity of authorship
is stamped upon the work throughout. Further, that
the Greek translation represents substantially the author’s
book which his grandson had before him is also practically
certain. On the other hand, it may be doubted whether
the book represents the final form which the author intended
it to have; whether he was interrupted in his work, or
whether he died before he was able to sift and arrange his
material, a careful study of the book leaves the impression
that the author left it in an incomplete state. The main
reasons for this belief are three: firstly, in many parts of the
book the material seems to be thrown down in a somewhat
chaotic state, whereas a little obvious sifting would put things
right; for example: in one section (xiv. 20-xvi. 23) the
following subjects are dealt with in this order—the blessedness
of seeking Wisdom which is only obtainable by those
who fear God; human free-will; the curse of ungodly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
children; God’s righteous anger against the wicked; it
is madness to imagine that one can avoid the notice of
God and therefore escape judgement because a man is
but an atom in a boundless creation. It is clear enough
that here we have some subjects which would follow upon
one another logically, only the sequence is broken by the
intrusion of other subjects which belong to a different
<i lang="fr">milieu</i>. A similar state of affairs occurs in various parts
of the book, while in many other parts, on the contrary,
we have sections in which there is a perfect sequence of
thought. Secondly, the same subject is treated in different
parts of the book; but in a well arranged scheme one would
naturally expect the different items of teaching on a given
subject to be gathered together into a consistent whole;
this <em>is</em> often done in the book, so that where we find the
contrary the natural supposition is that those parts in which
the contrary occurs have not assumed their final shape.
Examples of this are: on the curse of ungodly children,
xvi. 1-5, xxii. 3-6; on lending and becoming surety, viii.
12, 13, xxix. 1-20; on friendship, vi. 5-17, vii. 18, xii.
8-18, xxii. 19-26, xxxvii. 1-6; concerning the tongue, v.
9-vi. 1, xxiii. 7-15, xxviii. 13-26; on independence, xxix.
21-28, xxxiii. 19-23; and a number of other examples
could be given. Thirdly, there is inconsistency of teaching
on one or two cardinal points of doctrine; this is especially
so in the case of the doctrine of Sin; but as we have already
dealt with this in an earlier chapter<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> it will be unnecessary to
say anything further here. For these reasons, therefore, we
are led to the conclusion that the book in its present form
is not that which the author intended it to have finally.</p>

<p>Ben-Sira was not only an orthodox Jew, but he was also
a scribe, and a teacher. His grandson tells us in the
Prologue that his grandfather had devoted his life to the
study of “the Law, the prophets, and the other books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
of our fathers,” and that his object in doing so was that he
might, by teaching, help others to a knowledge of the Law,
as well as in carrying out its precepts. Ben-Sira’s own
words bear out the truth of this, for he is evidently speaking
from personal experience when he says: “Leisure increaseth
wisdom to the scribe” (xxxviii. 24); moreover, his very
intimate knowledge of the Old Testament is just what one
would expect of a scribe; this knowledge is evident on every
page of his book, which is saturated with the thoughts of the
Old Testament Wisdom Literature, almost the very words
of which occur again and again; in the concluding chapters
of his book (xliv.-l. 24) he sings the praises of all the great
ones of Israel, and shows how he has his Old Testament at
his fingers’ ends. Bearing in mind what is said in the
Prologue, it is highly probable that Ben-Sira is referring to
himself as the true scribe in writing the words in xxxviii.
24-xxxix. 3; here he passes in review various callings in life,
and declares that it is not possible for men to acquire wisdom
if their time is taken up in earning their livelihood by these
means; in describing, then, the manner in which he “who
meditates in the Law of the Most High” goes about his
work Ben-Sira sets forth the mental activity of the scribe
in such a way as to make it certain that he is imparting the
secrets of his own practice. He says of such an one that he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">Searcheth out the wisdom of all the ancients,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And is occupied with the prophets of old;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He heedeth the discourses of men of renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And entereth into the deep things of parables;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He searcheth out the hidden meaning of proverbs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And is conversant with the dark sayings of parables ... (xxxix. 1-3).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Obviously no true man who had given himself so whole-heartedly
to the study and acquisition of holy learning
would be content to keep it to himself, and so Ben-Sira
gives us clearly to understand that he was a teacher earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
desirous of imparting to others what he himself had learned
of Wisdom; so he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn in unto me, ye unlearned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And lodge in my house of instruction;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How long will ye lack these things?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And how long shall your soul be athirst?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I open my mouth and speak of her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Acquire Wisdom for yourselves without money ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hearken to my teaching, though ye be but few,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And much silver and gold shall ye acquire thereby (li. 23-28).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The similes used by Ben-Sira regarding himself as a successor
to teachers of Wisdom who had gone before are interesting
as showing that he claimed to be a link, though a
humble one, in the great chain of Israel’s inspired writers.
He says, for example, in one place:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And as for me, I was as a stream from the river,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And I came forth as a conduit into a garden;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I said: “I will water my garden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I will abundantly water my garden beds”;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lo, my stream became a river,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And my river became a sea ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet again will I pour forth doctrine as prophecy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And leave it for eternal generations.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look ye (and see) that I have not laboured for myself only,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But for all those that diligently seek her (xxiv. 30-34).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another passage he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, indeed, came last of all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As one that gleaneth after the grape-gatherers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I advanced by the blessing of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And filled my wine-press as a grape-gatherer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Consider that not for myself alone have I laboured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But for all that seek Wisdom (xxxiii. 16-18).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And once again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet again will I fix my thoughts and make my doctrine to shine forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As the full moon on the twelfth day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hearken unto me, ye pious ... (xxxix. 12 ff.).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All these passages show that Ben-Sira reckoned himself
as following in the line—though the last in the succession—of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
the wise men such as the writers of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes,
and that therefore his claim to be a teacher in Israel
was justified. While quoting freely from the Old Testament
writers, and thereby acknowledging his indebtedness to
them, he often expands a quotation, especially from Proverbs,
thus making the proverb into a little essay; so that
although he does not show great originality of thought, he
nevertheless has his own ideas which he sets forth in his own
way.</p>

<p>Some further details concerning the author may be gathered
from his book; if, as seems reasonable, the words of xxxix.
1-3, quoted above, are taken as referring to the writer
himself, then the same must be said of the words which
follow in the text, viz.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who serveth among great men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And appeareth before princes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who travelleth through the lands of the peoples,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And testeth good and evil among men (xxxix. 4);</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">from these words we may gather that Ben-Sira had at one
time been in the service of some influential person, and that
he had spent some time in travel; of that he speaks more
than once, for he says in xxxiv. 10-12:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He that is without experience knoweth little,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the well-versed man hath skill.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In my journeying I have seen much,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And many things have befallen me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Often was I in danger even unto death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But was preserved because of these things (i.e. experience and knowledge of the world).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another passage (li. 13) he refers to the time before he
had commenced his travels. The danger of which he speaks
in the passage just quoted was owing to the fact that he
had been the victim of some slanderous tongue, if one
may be guided by his words in li. 1-12, where he thanks
God in saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou didst preserve me from the scourge of a slanderous tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And from the lips of them that turn aside to lies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wast on my side in the face of those that rose up against me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thou didst help me, according to the abundance of Thy mercy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of the snare of them that watch for my stumbling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And from the hands of those that seek my life ...</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The book contains a very large number of moral maxims
and wise counsels for help and guidance in the every-day
affairs of life; but the earnest piety of the writer which
so frequently finds expression shows that his aim was
not merely to write a handbook on ethics, but far more
to be a spiritual adviser, wisdom in its manifold forms being,
according to him, so many illustrations of godliness. Finally,
“the mass of information which the book contains regarding
Jewish religion, thought, and ethics, during a period for
which we do not otherwise possess much knowledge, marks
it out as a work of high importance. The writer evidently
intended to offer to his people a kind of text-book to which
men and women might have recourse for guidance in almost
every conceivable circumstance of life. He does this,
however, with the primary object of setting in clear light
the superior excellence of Judaism over Hellenism. In
a sense, therefore, Ecclesiasticus may be regarded as an
apologetic work, inasmuch as it aims at combating the
rising influence of Greek thought and culture among the
Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Book</span></h4>

<p>In his Prologue to the Greek translation of the book
Ben-Sira’s grandson tells us that “in the eight and thirtieth
year under Euergetes the king, having come into Egypt
and continued there, I found opportunity for no small
instruction. I, therefore, deemed it most necessary myself
to devote some zeal and love-labour to (the task of) translating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
this book; devoting, indeed, much watchful care
and skill during the time at my disposal in order that, having
completed the book (i.e. its translation), I might publish it
for the benefit of those who in the land of their sojourning
were desirous to learn, being already prepared in respect of
their moral culture to live by the Law.” Those words
enable us to fix the date, approximately, of the translation
of the book; for there was only one Egyptian king of
the name of Euergetes to whom the translator’s words
could apply, namely Euergetes II, surnamed Physcon, who
reigned altogether fifty-four years; first he was joint-ruler
with his elder brother, Philometor (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 170-145), and then
he reigned alone (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 145-116).<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The thirty-eighth year
of his reign would be <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 132; soon after this date, therefore,
the Greek translation was made. Having got this
date it is not difficult to fix an approximate date for the
original work; it would be about fifty or sixty years earlier.
At the end of chapter xlix. and beginning of l., according to
the Hebrew of our book, it says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Great among his brethren, and the glory of his people</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was Simeon, the son of Jochanan, the priest.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This Simeon, the second of the name, was high-priest from
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 219-199; Ben-Sira was clearly a contemporary of his
(see l. 1 ff.), but the way in which he writes about him
suggests that Simeon must have been dead some time when
Ben-Sira wrote; we shall, therefore, not be far wrong in
assigning the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 180, or thereabouts, as the date
of the composition of the book in its original form. It is,
however, certain that the book was in preparation for some
years before this; for since, as we have already seen, Ben-Sira
had his own house of instruction where he gave lectures
to his pupils, we may justly assume that the contents of his
book represent the pith of these lectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Original Language of the Book; the recently
found Hebrew Manuscripts</span></h4>

<p>Apart from the fact that a large portion (about two-thirds)
of our book has in recent years been found in Hebrew, which
very often gives the original form, the following considerations
made it certain, even before this was found, that
the original language was Hebrew: in his Prologue to the
book the translator says: “Things originally spoken in
Hebrew have not the same force in them when they are
translated into another tongue; and not only these, but
the Law itself, and the Prophecies, and the rest of the books,
have no small difference when they are spoken in their
original form.” Although he does not actually say so, it is
pretty obvious that Ben-Sira’s grandson implies here that
he translated his grandfather’s book from Hebrew. In the
second place, in St. Jerome’s time it would appear that
Hebrew manuscripts of the book existed in Palestine, for
in his preface to the Books of Solomon he says that he found
the book of Jesus the son of Sirach in Hebrew. Then, again,
in later times Saadiah (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 920) speaks of the existence of
copies of the Hebrew text, and he says that the vowel-points
were added, which was, as a rule, only done in the case of
canonical books.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> And lastly, in a number of cases the
renderings of the Greek necessitate the assumption that
they were translated from Hebrew.</p>

<p>But all doubt, where such existed, was set at rest by the
discovery (1896-1900) of a number of fragments of the
Hebrew text. Those to whom this important find, or rather
series of finds, is due are Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Gibson, Cowley
and Neubauer, Schechter and Taylor, G. Margoliouth, Levi,
Adler, and Gaster. Altogether about thirty leaves were
found; they are fragments belonging to four different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
manuscripts, and they all came from the Genizah of a synagogue
in Cairo. As all these manuscripts are written on
paper and not on vellum they cannot be earlier than the
ninth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, for paper was not introduced until this
century<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>; they all belong probably to the end of the tenth
or the beginning of the eleventh century.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>The question arises as to whether the Hebrew of these
manuscripts is not a translation from the Greek or Syriac
forms of the text which had been in existence for a number
of centuries previously; and, further, it must be asked that
even supposing Hebrew to have been the original language
of the book, do these fragments present the original Hebrew,
or a later form of this? The answer to these questions
involves a detailed study of the text in its various forms,
and a comparison of these with the Hebrew text; clearly
a technical discussion of this kind would be out of place
here; we can only give a <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of the results of such study.
“As a general rule a text which is a translation betrays the
fact by certain indications which are almost infallible;
idiomatic expressions in the original, misunderstandings of
words in the original and consequent mistranslation which
interfere with the sense of a passage, clumsy diction owing
to difficulties in giving a proper rendering of the original;
these and other signs of the non-originality of a writing are
almost certain to show themselves; but the Hebrew of Ecclesiasticus
does not present signs of this kind. Its whole
style stamps its language as the original one; the symmetry
of the Hebrew, in the main, points in the same direction;
moreover, there are a number of instances which could be
given which exclude the possibility of translation from
either Greek or Syriac; there are also many cases in which
the Versions have no equivalent for the Hebrew; and lastly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
the Hebrew often contains a text so obviously superior to
that of the Versions that its originality cannot be disputed.
When we add to this that both the Greek and Syriac frequently
exhibit the well-known indications of translation,
it may be taken as certain that the Hebrew was the original
language in which Ecclesiasticus was written.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>But while it is thus evident that Hebrew was the original
language in which our book was written, it does not necessarily
follow that the recently found manuscripts contain
the original form of the Hebrew; indeed, there have not been
wanting scholars who have stoutly denied this, and who
maintain that this Hebrew is a translation of a Persian
rendering of a Syriac text<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>; or that it is, at any rate in
part, a translation from the Greek and Syriac.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Here, again, in
order to prove our point that, in the main, the Hebrew of the
recently found manuscripts does represent the original form,
numerous details of a technical character would be required<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
which would be out of place here; it must suffice to say that
“the text of the Hebrew, though it is disfigured by scribal
errors and corruptions, and—in some places—by the presence
of glosses, is yet essentially independent of the Greek and
the Syriac; the hypothesis of retranslation breaks down,
at best a plausible case for the influence of such a factor
can only be made out for an insignificant number of verses,
where, however, an alternative—and, on the whole, more
probable—explanation is possible.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Authorized and Revised Versions of
Ecclesiasticus</span></h4>

<p>In comparing the Authorized and Revised Versions it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
be seen that, apart from differences of rendering, there
is this fundamental difference between the two: the
Authorized Version contains a large number of verses which
are omitted in the Revised Version. These omissions
are noted in the Revised Version, for in the margin one constantly
comes across the words: “Verse ... is omitted
by the best authorities.” The reason of this difference
between the two Versions is that for the Revised Version
only the great uncials of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> were used;
whereas for the Authorized Version a number of cursive
manuscripts belonging to a much later time were used.
The procedure of the Revisers is justified on the grounds
of textual criticism, for as authorities the great uncial manuscripts
of the fourth century are far superior to the cursives
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; on the other
hand, the Authorized Version is not only supported by early
patristic authority, but also by that of the Old Latin Version
which contains many really ancient elements.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> There is,
of course, a great deal of matter common to the uncial
and cursive manuscripts as represented by the Revised
and Authorized Versions; but the difference between this
common matter and that which is peculiar to the cursives
is very marked; the additions, numbering a hundred and
fifty lines or more, besides many verbal additions (and it is
more than probable that both amounted to many more
originally), must have been added for some special reason,
and that reason, whatever it was, must have existed at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
very early date, for as we shall see, the additions have existed
since pre-Christian times.</p>

<p>As to these additions, what is their character, and
why were they added? The right answer to these
questions was first given by Mr. Hart, who holds that
they are “fragments of the Wisdom of a Scribe of the
Pharisees, and contain tentative Greek renderings of many
of the technical terms and watchwords of the Sect. As
Jesus Ben-Sira dealt with the earlier Scriptures, so some
unknown disciple dealt with his master’s composition.
He received the deposit and added to it.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Mr. Hart
works out this theory on pp. 275-320 of his book; following
his lead, we have studied the matter independently, and
have found that the more it is studied, the more firmly
is his theory substantiated. Before coming to deal in
some detail with this subject, it will be well to put the question:
Why should a Pharisee have felt it incumbent upon
him to make these additions? The answer, proof for which
will be offered in a moment, is that Ecclesiasticus in its
original form represents the “Sadducæan”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> standpoint,
and at the close of the Maccabæan struggle, when Pharisaism
appeared as an active movement and the Pharisees
became the dominant party in Israel, it was no doubt considered
essential that a book like Ecclesiasticus, which
was greatly in vogue (for, as far as it went, it was orthodox)
should bear on the face of it the marks of Pharisaic orthodoxy,
and thus become a vehicle for the propagation of
Pharisaism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>We shall now first seek to show that Ecclesiasticus in its
original form represented the traditional Sadducæan
standpoint, and that the additions reflect the teaching of
the Pharisees. We have already dealt with the specific
doctrines of these two parties, so that what is now to be
said should be read in the light of what has been written
in <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_VI">VI. <span class="smcap">The “Sadducæan” Doctrinal Standpoint in
Ecclesiasticus</span></h4>

<p>In considering first in what respects Josephus’ account
of the teaching of the Sadducees is reflected in Ecclesiasticus
it must be borne in mind that the book in its original
form was written before the distinctive doctrines of Pharisaism
had become formulated, and therefore before anything
in the nature of antagonism between Sadducæan
and Pharisaic teaching had arisen; “it is not to be supposed
that the two parties were from the first sharply divided,
still less that they acquired distinctive names. It is historically
more probable that the divergence increased
gradually, and was intensified, and at last definitely realized
in the religious revival of Maccabæan times.”<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The evidence
which Josephus gives is late; in his time the opposition
between the two parties had fully developed, and, as
so often happens between opposing parties, their respective
tenets tended to become exaggerated. Of this there is
naturally no sign in Ecclesiasticus. Cowley rightly points
out, in speaking of the Sadducees during the period that
succeeded the Maccabæan struggle, that “in their political
relations they show a sympathy with foreign influences
which was strongly reprobated by the nationalistic Pharisees.
Thus we find them accused, perhaps justly, of tolerating
Greek religious practices, and even of adopting them.
This is the less surprising if it be considered that the Judaism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
which they professed can have had (to use a modern phrase)
no religious hold on them. It was rather the machinery
by which a certain political system was worked, and when
circumstances changed it could be adapted to new conditions.”<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
So that when we speak of the Sadducæan
doctrinal standpoint in Ecclesiasticus it will be understood
that this is somewhat different from that which was
developed more than a century later owing largely to
opposition to Pharisaic teaching. Ben-Sira represents
traditional Judaism of a high type,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and in so far is to be
regarded as standing for conservative Sadducæanism;
but in many respects, and especially in that which regarded
devotional religion, which is such a prominent feature in
Ecclesiasticus, Pharisaism was identical with the best
that traditional Judaism offered; so that, from this point
of view, it may be said that Ben-Sira also represented
“Pharisaism,” though to use this term in speaking of the
time of Ben-Sira would, of course, be an anachronism.</p>

<p>We shall now take in order the doctrines of the Sadducees,
so far as we know them, and see in what ways they
are illustrated in our book. The utterly un-Jewish doctrine
that God takes no interest in the world of His creation
and that He is not concerned in men’s doing or not doing
what is evil was certainly not held by the “Sadducees”
in pre-Maccabæan times; its adoption must have been
due to Greek influence if Josephus is to be relied upon at
all here. Ben-Sira’s book is full of very different teaching;
indeed, in one striking passage he seems to be combating
something similar to the very doctrine with which
Josephus credits the Sadducees; in xvi. 17-23 he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Say not: “I am hidden from God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And in the height who will remember me?</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall not be noticed among so illustrious a people,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And what is my soul among the mass of the spirits of all the children of men?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In truth, unto me He will not have respect,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And as for my ways, who will mark them?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I sin, no eye beholdeth it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or if I deal untruly in all secrecy, who will know it?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My righteous dealing, who declareth it?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And what hope is there, for the decree is distant.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They that lack understanding think these things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the man of folly thinketh this.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Positive teaching on the close relationship which should
normally exist between God and men is given again and
again in the book. Ben-Sira’s doctrine of sin is inadequate,<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
it is true; but that is in spite of, not in consequence of,
his exalted teaching concerning God.</p>

<p>Regarding the teaching on human free-will Ben-Sira
sometimes reflects a thoroughly Sadducæan standpoint;
nothing could be more uncompromising, for example,
than this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">God created man from the beginning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And placed him in the hand of his <em>Yetzer</em>.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou so desirest, thou canst keep the commandment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And it is wisdom to do His good pleasure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poured out before thee are fire and water,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Stretch forth thine hand unto that which thou desirest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Life and death are before man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That which he desireth shall be given him (xv. 14-17).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With this may also be compared xxxvii. 17, 18:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The roots of the heart’s deliberations</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bring forth four branches:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good and evil, life and death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the tongue ruleth over them altogether.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, assertions regarding the action of
Divine grace are not wanting; perhaps the most pointed
of these is that contained in the words of xxxiii. 13-15:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">As the clay is in the power of the potter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To fashion it according to his good pleasure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So is man in the power of his Creator,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To make him according to His ordinance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over against evil stands the good, and against death life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Likewise over against the godly the sinner.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even thus look upon all the works of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Each different, one the opposite of the other.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the subject of immortality and resurrection the teaching
is entirely that of the Sadducees; a few passages will
illustrate this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">When a man dieth he inheriteth</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Worm and maggot, lice and creeping things (x. 11).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is callous counsel which Ben-Sira gives to a mourner,
for after telling him to mourn for “a day or two,” and to
be moderate in his sorrow because “sadness of heart prostrateth
vigour,” he concludes as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And let him no more occupy thy thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Dismiss the remembrance of him, and remember (thy) end.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remember him not, for he hath no hope;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thou canst not profit him, while thou harmest thyself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remember his doom, for it is the doom of thyself;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His yesterday, and thine to-day!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the dead is at rest, let his memory rest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And be consoled when his soul departeth (xxxviii. 16-23).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same dreary belief, or rather non-belief, occurs in
xli. 3, 4:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear not death, it is thy destiny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Remember that the former and the latter share it with thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the portion of all flesh from God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And how canst thou withstand the decree of the Most High!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be it for a thousand years, for a hundred, or for ten that thou livest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In Sheol there are no reproaches concerning life (cp. xvii. 27, 28).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are various other passages to the same effect,
while none occur which show the slightest advance on the
teaching which these contain.</p>

<p>Regarding the attitude towards the non-Jewish world,
Ben-Sira is distinctly tolerant; it was the Maccabæan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
struggle which hardened the Jews towards the Gentiles;
nevertheless, Ben-Sira has no doubt about the superiority
of his own race. The attitude which is more in accordance
with that of the Sadducees may be seen in the whole passage
xviii. 8-14, where he speaks of man generally, and teaches
that God’s mercy is extended universally:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The mercy of man is exercised upon his own kin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the mercy of God is extended to all flesh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reproving, and chastening, and teaching,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">bringing them back as a shepherd his flock (verse 13).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same universalistic spirit is exhibited in xxxvi. 17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wilt hear the prayer of Thy servants,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">According to Thy good favour towards Thy people;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That all the ends of the earth may know</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That Thou art the eternal God.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A striking passage containing similar teaching is xxxvi.
1-5:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Save us, O God of all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And cast Thy fear upon all the nations.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shake Thy hand against the strange people,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And let them see Thy power.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Thou hast sanctified Thyself in us before them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So glorify Thyself in them before us;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That they may know as we also know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That there is none other God but Thee.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The only passage (in the original form of the book) of a particularistic
character is that in which Wisdom is described in
having taken up her abode in Israel (xxiv. 6-16), but here
it has to be remembered that one of Ben-Sira’s great objects
in writing his book was to show the superiority of Israel’s
wisdom over that of the Greeks. This, however, is quite
different from the later Pharisaic spirit of active hostility
to all the Gentile world.</p>

<p>There are a few passages which seem to be uttered against
the Oral Law. It is true, the <em>data</em> we possess regarding the
beginnings of the formation of the Oral Law are very scanty;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
but it may be safely asserted that, in its technical sense, this
was, to some considerable extent, in existence for at least half
a century before Ecclesiasticus was written; it is, therefore,
probable that Ben-Sira uttered the following words as a
protest against what he considered a dangerous innovation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He that seeketh out the Law shall gain her,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the hypocrite shall be snared thereby.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They that fear Jehovah discern His judgement,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And elicit guidance from the darkness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The man of violence wresteth reproofs,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And forceth the Law to suit his necessity (xxxii. 15-17).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this connection it is worth noting that although Ben-Sira
approves of the laws concerning the sacrificial system
“because it is commanded,” he does not regard their literal
observance as binding; he teaches the equal efficacy of
spiritual sacrifices in a way which would not have received
the approval of the Pharisees, at any rate as long as the
Temple was standing; thus, in xxxiv. 18-26 he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacrifice of the unrighteous man is a mocking offering,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And unacceptable are the oblations of the godless.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Most High hath no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither doth He forgive sins for a multitude of sacrifices....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He who washeth after contact with a dead body and toucheth it again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What hath he gained by his washing?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So a man fasting for his sins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And again doing the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who will listen to his prayer?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And what hath he gained by his humiliation?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he continues, in xxxv. 1-3, to advocate spiritual
sacrifices, though in the verses that follow he urges men
not to appear with empty hands in the presence of the Lord;
his words in xxxv. 1-3 are as follows—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He that keepeth the Law multiplieth offerings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He sacrificeth a peace-offering that heedeth the commandments;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He that practiseth kindness offereth fine flour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he that doeth mercy sacrificeth a thank-offering....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>Another fact which is worth emphasizing is that there is no
mention of angels or demons in the book; this is more or
less in accordance with Sadducæan theology. Finally, on
the general subject of the Sadducæan standpoint of the
book, we may quote some important words of Dr. Taylor.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
He says: “We have no authentic remains of Sadducee
literature, but it has been suggested with a certain plausibility
that the book Ecclesiasticus approximates to the
standpoint of the primitive Caduqin (Sadducees) as regards
its theology, its sacerdotalism, and its want of sympathy
with the <em>modern</em> Soferim (Scribes). The name of Ezra is
significantly omitted from its catalogue of worthies. ‘It
remains singular,’ remarks Kuenen, ‘that the man whom
a later generation compared, nay, made almost equal, to
Moses, is passed over in silence.... Is it not really most
natural that a Jesus ben Sirach did not feel sympathy enough
for the first of the Scribes to give him a place of honour in
the series of Israel’s great men?’” Dr. Taylor mentions
also the important fact that in the Babylonian Talmud
(Sanhedrin 100<i>b</i>) the Books of the Sadducees and the Book
of Ben-Sira are placed side by side on the “Index expurgatorius.”
All that has been said receives confirmation
from the further fact that in the Hebrew text of the Canticle<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
which follows l. 12, these words occur—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give thanks unto Him that gave the sons of Zadok to be priests,</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">For His mercy endureth for ever.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Enough has now been said to show that our book in its
original form represented the Sadducæan standpoint. We
have now to deal with the Pharisaic additions.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_VII">VII. <span class="smcap">The Pharisaic Additions to Ecclesiasticus.</span></h4>

<p>The brief reference to specific Pharisaic doctrines given in
chapter VII, § iii. (<i>a</i>) above, will enable us to form an opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
regarding the character of the additions to Ecclesiasticus. That
these additions<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> were made by a Pharisee, or Pharisees, has
already been asserted; but we must now seek to substantiate
the assertion. We cannot do more here than give a few
illustrations out of a large number; and in order not to
weary the reader we will merely quote the addition in each
case without specifying in which manuscripts or Versions it
occurs.</p>

<p>In illustration of what has been said about the Pharisaic
teaching concerning God and man’s relations to Him the
following examples will be found instructive. In xvi. 19
occurs this addition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The whole world was made, and existeth, by His will.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A stronger assertion of the divine governance of the world
is added to xviii. 2:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who guideth the world in the hollow of His hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all things are obedient unto His will;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For He is the King of all kings, and they are in His power;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He separateth among them the holy things from the common.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An example of the intimate relationship existing between
God and men is the addition to xxiii. 27:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">To follow after God is great glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And length of days it is for thee to be accepted of Him.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again in the addition to xxiv. 23:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Faint not, but be strong in the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And cleave unto Him that He may strengthen you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cleave unto Him, the Lord, the Almighty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He is the one and only God, and beside Him there is no Saviour.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although not explicitly stated it is men of Israel who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
meant in these quotations, but sometimes Israel is specially
mentioned; so, for example, in the addition to xvii. 17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom [i.e. Israel] He brought up as His first-born</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With severity, yet loving them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imparting to them the light of love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He forsook them not.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This teaching of the Divine governance of the world, involving
as it does man’s dependence upon God, is balanced
by the doctrine of human free-will; an example of this
may be seen in the addition to xx. 31:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Better is persistent endurance (<i>lit.</i> patience) in seeking the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Than a driver (<i>lit.</i> charioteer) of his own life without a master.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this couplet the Pharisaic doctrine of man’s free-will is
maintained, while the Sadducæan denial of providence is
combated.</p>

<p>Turning now to the teaching of the Pharisees concerning
the future life, the following addition is found after xix. 17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is life-giving instruction,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they who do the things that are pleasing unto Him shall pluck the fruit of the tree of immortality.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The teaching of reward hereafter for the righteous may be
instanced from xviii. 22 and the addition to this verse.
The original text runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Delay not to pay thy vow in due time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wait not till death to be justified.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Death is here regarded as a means of atonement, as in the
later Rabbinical literature; but from the Pharisaic point
of view these words seemed inadequate, so the following
words were added:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the reward of God abideth to eternity.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has been stated above that <em>repentance</em> was one of the
watchwords of the Pharisees; for the Sadducees, with their
cold doctrine of God, repentance could have had but little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
meaning; not that Ben-Sira did not teach the need of
repentance (see xviii. 21; but in xliv. 16 the Greek text is
corrupt), but it occupies an extremely modest place in his
book, and therefore we shall not be surprised to find that
it is insisted upon several times in the additions; thus
after the words of the text of xvii. 22:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The righteousness of men is to Him as a signet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the mercy of man He preserveth as the apple of an eye,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the following addition is made:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Granting repentance to his sons and daughters.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, after xx. 2 this addition occurs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">How good it is when he who is reproved manifesteth repentance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For thus wilt thou escape wilful sin.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As regards the Pharisaic teaching concerning the Law
much stress cannot be laid on the few examples of its mention
in the additions, for at the time when these were made<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
it is improbable that the antagonism between Pharisees
and Sadducees on this point had fully developed; if it had,
we should rightly expect to find it more strongly reflected
in the additions; whereas, as a matter of fact, quite a few
examples of the mention of the Law (or the commandments)
occur in the additions; nevertheless, since the
Law played such a very important part in Pharisaic teaching,
its mention in the additions would naturally point to
the hand of a Pharisee. In the addition which has been
put in after xi. 14, the Law is referred to as a divine gift,
and therefore (so it is implied) he who observes it by walking
uprightly is making use of a Divine gift; on the other
hand, to live without the Law is folly and darkness which
is characteristic of sinners:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wisdom and insight and discernment of the Law</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Come from the Lord;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Love and upright ways</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Come from the Lord;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Folly and darkness have been formed for sinners,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And as for evil-doers, evil abideth with them.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, in xxix. 19, after the first clause:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sinner falleth in his suretyship,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">occurs the addition: “Transgressing the commandments
of the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The reference is to evil men who, as the second line of the
verse shows, are ruined because they become surety for
evil purposes, i.e. for the sake of usurious practices; the
addition was, therefore, made in order to emphasize the fact
that this was a transgression of the Law.</p>

<p>Finally, what Josephus says about the asceticism of the
Pharisees is illustrated by the addition to xix. 5. The
original text here runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He that hath pleasure in wickedness shall be brought to destruction;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">an ascetic tendency is clearly discernible in the Pharisaic
addition which says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And he that averteth his eye from pleasures crowneth his life.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These examples will suffice, it may be hoped, to substantiate
the contention that the numerous later additions
which have for the most part been preserved in the cursive
manuscripts mentioned above are the work of a Pharisee,
or Pharisees.</p>

<p>That these additions are post-Maccabæan goes without
saying; but closer indications of date are not forthcoming,
so that we cannot do more than say that they belong in
all probability to the last century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span></span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHI_VIII">VIII. <span class="smcap">The Value of the Book for the Study of the
New Testament</span></h4>

<p>The main value of the books of the Apocrypha for the
study of the New Testament—it may be said here once for
all—lies in their doctrinal teaching. This we have already
dealt with in the last chapter of Part I. But there are
some other ways, also useful, though of less importance,
whereby these books can be utilized for New Testament
study. Some of them, and above all Ecclesiasticus, throw
much light on the customs and manner of life of the Jews
which helps us in a number of particulars to understand
the Gospels better; others, such as Judith, illustrate the
intensely national feeling of the Jews which helps to explain
much that we read in the Acts, especially St. Paul’s
treatment by the Jews; or, again, the early part of Baruch
gives us some insight into the long prayers which were in
vogue among the Jews; Wisdom shows us, among other
things, the Hellenistic spirit whereby not a few Jews,
especially those of the Dispersion, were animated; this
is important for the understanding of much that we read
in the Pauline epistles. Other points will suggest themselves
to thoughtful readers of these books. It is not,
however, with matters of this kind that we can deal here,
for space would not permit of it. What we intend to
touch upon briefly in the final section of each of these introductions
to the Apocryphal books, when called for, is chiefly
(though not exclusively) their use for the study of the New
Testament from a literary point of view, the main purpose
being to try and show that the writers of the New Testament
books had read and studied those of the Apocrypha;
not, of course, that these writers were as familiar with them
as with the canonical books of the Old Testament, but that
they valued them and utilized them, some more than others.
This is to be expected from the outset, both because the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
Old Testament they used contained these books as integral
parts of the “Scriptures,” and because the early Church
Fathers held them in high estimation; this latter is not
likely to have been the case unless that attitude towards
these books had been handed down.</p>

<p>There are, firstly, a few examples, among many, of parallel
thoughts between Ecclesiasticus and the Gospels which
may be pointed out:</p>

<table class="autotable fs90">
<tr>
<td class="tdc">Ecclesiasticus.</td>
<td class="tdc">St. Matthew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdlx wd50">xxviii. 2. Forgive thy neighbour the injury done to thee. And then, when thou prayest, thy sins will be forgiven.</td>
<td class="tdlx">vi. 14. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdlx"></td>
<td class="tdc">St. Luke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdlx">xlviii. 10. [Speaking of Elijah] ... To turn the heart of fathers unto the children.</td>
<td class="tdlx">i. 17. And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>The verbal identity between the two passages here
suggests either direct influence, or else that a current saying
(from Mal. iv. 6) has been adopted in each.</p>

<table class="autotable fs90">
<tr>
<td class="tdlx wd50">xi. 19. What time he saith, I have found rest, And now will I enjoy my goods,— He knoweth not what lot shall befall; He shall leave them to others, and die.</td>
<td class="tdlx">xii. 19, 20 ... And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry. But God said unto him,
  Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Cp. also Ecclesiasticus xxxi. 3 with the Lucan passage
last quoted.</p>

<p>Examples of other small details illustrative of the usefulness
of Ecclesiasticus for this purpose are i. 1-20, which
offers an interesting commentary on Matthew xi. 19: “Wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
is justified by her works” (cp. the various reading in
Luke vii. 35). The visitation of the sick referred to in
Matthew xxv. 39 is illustrated by Ecclesiasticus vii. 35:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Forget not to visit the sick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For thou wilt be loved for that.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Evidently this was a duty laid upon all good Jews. And,
once more, the custom of wagging the head in sign of mockery
mentioned in Matthew xxvii. 39 is also referred to in
Ecclesiasticus xii. 18. Numbers of similar, small but interesting,
points offer themselves to students of the book.</p>

<p>But the most striking fact in this connection is that of
the many parallel thoughts and passages between Ecclesiasticus
and the Epistle of St. James; these are of such
a nature as to justify belief in the direct influence of the
former on the latter. A few examples are appended<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>:</p>

<table class="autotable fs90">
<tr>
<td class="tdc">Ecclesiasticus.</td>
<td class="tdc">St. James.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdlx">i. 26. If thou desire Wisdom, keep the commandments, And the Lord will give her freely unto thee.</td>
<td class="tdlx">i. 5. But if any of you lacketh Wisdom, let him ask of God, Who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given unto him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdlx">xv. 11-13. Say not, From God is my trangression, For that which He hateth made He not. Say not, It is He that made me to stumble. For there is no need of evil men. Evil and abomination doth the Lord hate, And He doth not let it come nigh to them that fear Him.</td>
<td class="tdlx">i. 13, 14. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man; but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdlx">v. 11. Be swift to hear, But with patience make reply.</td>
<td class="tdlx">i. 19. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdlx"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
vii. 35, 36. Forget not to visit the sick, For thou wilt be loved for that. In all thy doings remember thy last end, Then wilt thou never do corruptly.</td>
<td class="tdlx">i. 27. Pure religion and undefiled before God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</td>

<p class="drop-capy">Before we come to deal with the Book of Tobit it will
be well, for reasons which will become apparent as
we proceed, to relate the story of Achikar the Wise. This
story must at one time have been very widespread and
popular. It has come down to us in several forms which
differ largely from each other, but which are, nevertheless,
all variations of the same story in their essence. A much
mutilated form of the story was found among the recently
discovered Aramaic <i>papyri</i> of Elephantiné, which shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
that it was current among the Jews at least as early
as the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Sennacherib, King of Assyria, had a vizier named Achikar,
a wise and erudite scribe. He conducted the affairs of the
kingdom wisely and well. When the king died, and Esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead, Achikar continued to hold
the same office. In course of time Achikar became very
rich, and he had many wives, and built many castles; but
he had no son. And as he grew old he felt the want of a son
more and more. Then he prayed earnestly that he might
have a son. In reply to his prayer it was told him that no
son should be granted him, but that he must instead adopt
Nadin,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> his nephew. This Achikar did, and educated
Nadin carefully, teaching him all manner of wisdom. Now
when Achikar felt the weakness of old age coming upon him
he besought the king that he would appoint Nadin vizier
in his place. This the king consented to do; and Nadin
was made vizier. But Nadin did not follow the wise
counsels which he had received from Achikar; but scattered
his words, as it were, to the wind; and he ill-treated the
servants and handmaidens of his uncle, and slew his horses,
and harmed his mules. And when Achikar sought to
correct the misguided course of his adopted son, Nadin
slandered him in the ears of the king, and accused him of
traitorous intercourse with the enemies of the kingdom,
laying at the same time forged letters before the king in
proof of Achikar’s guilt. Then the king showed the letters
to Achikar, and sought an explanation; but Achikar was
so horrified and taken aback that he could not utter a word.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
The king, taking this as a sign of guilt, gave command
that Achikar should be put to death. But the officer,
Nabusemakh, to whom this command was given, had, years
ago, been indebted to Achikar for the saving of his life
when he had been the victim of a false accusation similar to
that now made against Achikar. So Nabusemakh spared
Achikar’s life, and hid him secretly in a hiding-place underground.
In Achikar’s place a slave was executed who was
already under sentence of death. Now when Pharaoh, king
of Egypt, heard of the death, as he supposed, of the wise
vizier, he rejoiced greatly, and sent a letter of the following
import to Esarhaddon:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to Esarhaddon,<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> king of Assyria and
Nineveh, greeting. I am planning to build a castle between heaven
and earth; wherefore seek out and send me from thy kingdom a
man who is a skilled architect, that he may give me reply concerning
all that I shall ask him. And when thou shalt send me such
a man, I will collect and send thee the revenue of Egypt for three
years. And if thou send me not a man who shall give me reply
concerning all that I ask him, then do thou collect and send me
the tribute of Assyria and Nineveh for three years, by the hands of
these ambassadors that come to thee.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then Esarhaddon took counsel with Nadin and all the wise
men as to what should be done; and they were in much
perplexity, for they found no one among their number
sufficiently wise to build a castle betwixt heaven and earth.
Thereupon, Nabusemakh came and told the king how
that he had spared Achikar’s life. The king, so far from
punishing Nabusemakh for having disobeyed the royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
command, was only too delighted to hear that Achikar was
still alive, and richly rewarded Nabusemakh. Then Achikar
was brought, and declared himself ready and able to answer
all that the king of Egypt should ask. When Achikar
came to the court of the king of Egypt he said he would
show the king how to build a castle betwixt heaven and
earth. Then he asked that lime and stone and clay and
workmen might be held in readiness. When all was prepared
Achikar let out of a box which he had brought with
him two eagles with ropes tied to their feet; upon each
eagle he set a boy; and as the eagles soared upward and
remained betwixt heaven and earth, the boys began to
shout: “Bring bricks, bring clay, that we may build the
king’s castle, for we are standing idle.” But the king
found no means of supplying them with bricks and clay up
in the air, and had perforce to give up the idea of building a
castle betwixt heaven and earth. Thus did Achikar the
Wise deliver king Esarhaddon from his embarrassment.
Achikar was placed again at the head of the royal household
and greatly honoured. On being asked by the king what
else he desired, he replied: “Bid them give me my son
Nadin, that I may teach him a further lesson; for he has
forgotten my former teaching.” Then Achikar caused
Nadin to be bound and thrashed; after which he was confined
in a dark chamber at the entrance to Achikar’s house;
and every time Achikar went in or out he uttered precepts
of wisdom for Nadin’s benefit. Finally Nadin “swelled
up like a bag and died.”</p>

<p>The moral of the story, with which it concludes, is given
thus: “To him that doeth good, what is good shall be
recompensed; and to him that doeth evil, what is evil
shall be rewarded. And he that diggeth a pit for his neighbour,
filleth it with his own stature.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This story of Achikar the Wise must have enjoyed great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
popularity in ancient times, for it has come down to us in
various forms; and its existence among the Jews, in the
fifth century, living at such an out-of-the-way spot as
Elephantiné, is eloquent testimony of how widespread the
knowledge of the story was. That the various forms differ
from each other very much is quite in the natural order of
things, for a popular story not only undergoes change when
passed from hand to hand, but sometimes it may assume a
form almost unrecognizable at first, and only when the
essential <em>traits</em> are sought behind the external appearance
can the kernel of the original story be recognized. It is,
therefore, not surprising that great differences are found in
the Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Aramaic, Aethiopic, Hebrew,
Slavonic and Greek forms of the story which are still preserved.
But in the case of all these, in spite of variations of
form and matter, and in spite of the addition of many
extraneous details drawn from different sources, the original
story lies imbedded and shows itself to have been utilized
to a greater or less extent.</p>

<p>Now the particular interest that the story of Achikar the
Wise has for the study of the Book of Tobit lies in the fact
that the writer of the latter utilized the former in the composition
of his book; he assumes, moreover, as we shall see,
a knowledge of the story of Achikar the Wise among his
readers.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHII_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Relationship between the Book of Tobit and
the Story of Achikar the Wise.</span></h4>

<p>It should be said at the outset that the best form of the
Greek text of the Book of Tobit is that of <cite lang="la">Codex Sinaiticus</cite>;
it is this text which has been utilized here.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>The first and most obvious point of interest in this connection
centres in the person of Achikar. In the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
Tobit he appears, when first mentioned, quite incidentally,
as though he were well known.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> In i. 21, 22, after the
assassination of Sennacherib by his two sons has been
referred to, it continues: “And they fled unto the mountains
of Ararat, and Sacherdonos [Esarhaddon] his son reigned
after him; and he appointed Acheikaros [Achikar], the son
of Anael my brother, over all the tribute of his kingdom,
and he had authority over all the conduct of affairs. Then
Acheikaros put me right [i.e. with the king], and I came
down unto Nineveh. For Acheikaros had been the chief
cup-bearer, and (keeper) of the signet,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and the chief
minister, and overseer of the tribute under Sennachereim
[Sennacherib], king of Assyria, and Sacherdonos appointed
him a second time (to these offices).”</p>

<p>This agrees with what is said about the position of Achikar
in the story given above.</p>

<p>In xi. 18 it is said that Achikar and Nadab, his cousin,
came to the wedding of Tobias. This sudden mention of
Nadab, who has not been referred to before in the book,
in connection with Achikar is curious as it stands, and shows
clearly enough that the writer of the book must have been
familiar with the story of Achikar, and that he assumed
the same of his readers. The slight variation in the form
of the name (Nadab for Nadin), and his being called the
cousin instead of the nephew of Achikar, does not affect the
main point.</p>

<p>But the most striking proof that the writer of Tobit
utilized the story of Achikar is seen by his reference to it in
xiv. 10: “And now do thou, my child, go forth from
Nineveh, and abide not here. In the day in which thou
buriest thy mother with me, in that self-same day tarry no
longer in these parts. For I see that there is much unrighteousness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
in her [i.e. Nineveh], and much deception is
practised in her, and they are not ashamed. Behold, my
child, what things Nadab did to Acheikaros who nourished
him; was he not brought living into the earth? And
God requited his iniquity before his face; and Acheikaros
came forth into the light, and Nadab entered into eternal
darkness because he sought to slay Acheikaros. In that
he [i.e. Acheikaros] showed me mercy he came forth out of
the snare of death which Nadab set for him; and Nadab
fell into the snare of death, and it destroyed him.” The
real kernel of the Achikar story is contained in these words,
namely that Achikar brought up an adopted son who betrayed
his benefactor by causing him to dwell in darkness underground;
but ultimately Achikar is saved and Nadab suffers
the fate which he had designed for his benefactor. Thus
righteousness triumphs, and Nemesis overtakes the wicked.
It is round this story that the wisdom of Achikar is woven;
and some of the wise sayings of Achikar are re-echoed
in Tobit, which further illustrates the indebtedness of the
writer to the Achikar story; a few examples of this may be
given:</p>

<p>There are other minor indications of the writer of Tobit
having utilized the Achikar story, such as the unusual double
description of the empire, “Assyria and Nineveh,” in the
earliest recension of our book<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> (xiv. 4, 15, cp. i. 3), which
occurs also in the Achikar story (i. 1); but the <em>data</em> given are
sufficient to show that the Achikar story is without doubt
one of the sources of the Book of Tobit. The object which
the writer had in introducing some of the Achikar story
elements into his book was probably that it might be
popularized thereby. The Achikar story must have been
immensely popular when one remembers the manifold forms
in which it has come down to us; and the Book of Tobit, by
being in some sort connected with it, would have commended
itself to Gentiles, as well as to Jews.</p>

<p>That the author of our book utilized other non-Jewish
sources in composing it is very probable. There is, for example,
a striking resemblance in one or two particulars between the
Book of Tobit and the “Story of the grateful dead man,”
an Armenian tale, according to which a wealthy man was
once riding through a forest when he came upon some men
misusing a corpse; on inquiring the reason for this he is
told that the dead man had owed them money; he pays the
dead man’s debt, and buries the corpse. He then continues
his journey home. Now in the city in which he dwelt there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
lived a rich man who had an only daughter; she had
married five husbands, but in each case the husband had died
on the night of the wedding. The hero of the tale resolves,
at the instance of an unknown serving-man, to seek this
woman in marriage in spite of what has occurred. He
succeeds in his desire. But on the night of the wedding
there issues forth from the mouth of his bride a serpent
which seeks to bite him and thus kill him; but the unknown
serving-man, who had been keeping guard, slays the serpent,
and thus saves the life of the bridegroom, to whom he then
makes himself known as the dead man whose corpse the
bridegroom had buried in the forest.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The <em>traits</em> common
to this story and the Book of Tobit are so marked that it is
difficult to believe that there is no connection between the
two; that the latter is indebted to the former is probable
because of the very widespread existence of the “Story of
the grateful dead man” in various forms in Asia and Europe.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Another possible source, but less striking than that just
referred to, is “The Tractate of Khons,” which was
originally written for the purpose of propagating the cult of
the Egyptian god Khons; in it occurs the story of a
beautiful princess who was possessed by a demon, but by
the help of Khons the demon was expelled and the princess
cured.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Contents of the Book of Tobit</span></h4>

<p>In the first part of the book, chapters i.-iii., Tobit relates
how he, his wife Anna, and his son Tobias, had been carried
away captive to Nineveh in the days of Shalmaneser, king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
of Assyria; he emphasizes his loyalty to the Law, saying
that he and his family had always been careful in keeping the
ordinances of the Law both when they lived in their own
land as well as in the land of their exile. He mentions
specially his ardent zeal in giving alms, and in according
decent burial to those of his race who had been murdered
and whose dead bodies had been cast out of the walls of the
city. Once when he was about to sit down to table at the
feast of Pentecost he bade his son go out and seek someone
who was in want and bring him in to partake of the feast.
Tobias, his son, went forth accordingly; but he soon returned
and reported to his father that one of his race had but now
been murdered, and that his body lay in the market-place.
Tobit went out forthwith, and took up the body from the
street and laid it in one of the chambers till sunset, when he
intended to bury it. And when the sun was set, he digged
a grave and buried the dead body. But as he had touched
a dead body he was unclean, and therefore could not re-enter
his house, lest by contact he should cause others to be
unclean,<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> so he laid down in the courtyard by the side
of a wall, and because it was hot he left his face uncovered;
but the droppings of some sparrows fell into his eyes, and he
became blind. There follows here a short section (ii. 11-14)
about Anna, which is quite out of place. The story is taken
up again at chapter iii., which tells of Tobit’s sorrow at his
affliction, and of his prayer to God that he may die (verses
1-6). Then a new element in the story is introduced.
Sarah, the daughter of Raguel of Ecbatana in Media, suffers
reproach because she has no child, although she has had
seven husbands; each of these husbands had, however, been
slain by Asmodæus, “the evil demon,” on the night of his
wedding. Sarah, like Tobit, prays in her great affliction that
she may die. Tobit and Sarah, though they know nothing
of each other, have therefore this in common, that they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
both in dire distress. Before proceeding with his story the
narrator adds a note for the comfort of his readers to the
effect that God had sent Raphael, the angel, to heal them
both: “in the case of Tobit to remove the white films
from his eyes, that he might see the light of God with his
eyes; and in the case of Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, to
give her for a wife to Tobias, the son of Tobit, and to unbind
Asmodæus the evil demon from her” (iii. 17).</p>

<p>The next section, chapters iv.-xi., which forms the bulk
of the book, deals with the journey of Tobias to Media in
order to bring back money which Tobit had left in trust
with Gabael. The advice which Tobit gives his son preparatory
to his starting is contained in iv. 3-21. He also
bids his son find a trusty companion who will travel with
him; this he does, the companion being none other than
the angel Raphael, who had been sent by God for the purpose.
Raphael, of course, does not reveal himself to Tobias.
Then the departure takes place (v.-vi. 2).</p>

<p>Soon after they started they met with an adventure, for
one evening as Tobias was washing in the river a great fish
caught him by the foot; but with his companion’s help the
fish was caught and brought to land. His companion the
angel, who has taken the name of Azarias, bids him keep the
gall and the liver and the heart of the fish, for the two latter
when burned make a smoke which will drive away demons,
while the gall is efficacious for curing white films which may
have formed themselves on the eyes of a man. Tobias
does as he is bidden (vi. 2-9). On their nearing Ecbatana
Raphael tells Tobias that he must marry Sarah the daughter
of Raguel as being nearest of kin; but Tobias expresses his
fears that he may fall a victim to the same evil demon who
had already caused the death of Sarah’s seven husbands.
Thereupon Raphael reminds him of the liver and heart of the
fish, which Tobias had kept, and he is told to place them
upon the ashes of incense at the proper time, when the smell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
of the smoke will drive the demon away (vi. 10-18). On
their arrival at the house of Raguel they are welcomed
by their host; Raphael makes all arrangements with
regard to the marriage between Tobias and Sarah. At the
proper time Tobias burns the liver and heart of the fish with
all success; there is rejoicing and feasting in the house of
Raguel (vii., viii.). At Tobias’ request Raphael goes to
Gabael and fetches the money belonging to Tobit (ix.).</p>

<p>In the meantime Tobias’ parents are beginning to feel
anxious about his long delay (x. 1-7<i>a</i>). Tobias and his wife,
Sarah, however, return to Nineveh to the great joy of Tobit
and Anna. The first act of Tobias on seeing his blind father
again is to bring out the gall of the fish and apply it to the
latter’s eyes; the beneficial effect is immediate; Tobit
regains his sight, and weeps for joy (x. 7<i>b</i>-xi. 8).</p>

<p>The last section of the book (xii.-xiv.) tells of Raphael
making himself known to Tobit, and of the wisdom of
Raphael, after which is added an account of Raphael’s
ascension (xii.); the two last chapters give the prayer of
Tobit (xiii.), and his last words (xiv.).</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Religious Standpoint of the Writer</span></h4>

<p>In various important particulars the writer of the Book
of Tobit and Ben-Sira occupy the same religious standpoint;
in others a certain divergence is to be noticed which points to
a development of doctrine. A brief examination of the
religious standpoint of the two writers is, therefore, both
interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) We will refer first to those points in which the teaching
is identical.</p>

<p>With regard to the Temple cultus at Jerusalem it will
suffice to quote one passage from each book to show the
identity of view; in Tobit i. 6-8 occur these words: “I
used to go to Jerusalem with the firstfruits and the firstlings
and the tenths of the cattle and the first shearings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
sheep, and give them to the priests, the sons of Aaron, for
the altar, and the tenth of the corn and the wine and oil and
pomegranates and the rest of the fruits to the sons of Levi,
who ministered at Jerusalem ...” (cp. ii. 1-9). Quite in
accordance with this are Ben-Sira’s words in vii. 29-31:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fear God with all thy heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And reverence His priests.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all thy strength love Him that made thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And forsake not His ministers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glorify God and honour the priest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And give them their portion as it is commanded thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The food of the trespass-offering, and the heave-offering of the hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The sacrifices of righteousness, and the offerings of holy things</div>
    <div class="verse indent39">(xxxv. 1-11, xlv. 14-16).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both writers lay much stress on other legal ordinances,
above all on Prayer and Almsgiving; these do not need
illustrating, as they are so often spoken of in either book;
but two points, the <em>spirit</em> and the <em>efficacy</em> of almsgiving, are
worth special mention: in Tobit iv. 16 it is said: “Let
not thine eye be grudging when thou givest alms,” and a
similar spirit of whole-heartedness is enjoined in Ecclesiasticus
xviii. 15-18:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">My son, bring no blemish on thy good deeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor in giving any gift cause grief through words....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gift of an envious man consumeth the eyes.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In like manner the efficacy of alms is spoken of by both
writers in an identical sense; in Tobit iv. 10 it is said:
“Alms delivereth from death, and suffereth not to come
into darkness”; and Ben-Sira says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">A flaming fire doth water quench,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So doth almsgiving atone for sin.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Both writers, moreover, use the word as almost synonymous
with righteousness. Fasting, strange to say, receives
practically no notice in Tobit,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> though Ben-Sira insists upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
its right use (xxxiv. 26). On one other point of legal
observance, however, both writers lay similar emphasis; in
Tobit ii. 8, 10 Tobit says: “And when the sun was set, I
went and digged a grave and buried him.... And the same
night I washed myself and came into my courtyard and lay
down to sleep ...”; the observance of this legal precept
is referred to by Ben-Sira in these words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He who washeth after (contact with) a dead body, and toucheth it again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What hath he gained by his bathing? (xxxiv. 25).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The similarity of the religious standpoint of these two
writers may be further illustrated by their <em>universalistic</em>
attitude and their teaching on the <em>future life</em>. Although,
normally, Ben-Sira looks upon Israel as pre-eminently the
nation upon which God’s interest is centred he shows a
broader outlook in such a passage as xviii. 1-14:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... As a drop of water from the sea, or as a grain of sand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So are man’s few years in the eternal days.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore is the Lord long-suffering towards them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And poureth out His mercy upon them....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mercy of man is exercised upon his own kin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the mercy of God is extended to all flesh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reproving, and chastening, and teaching,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And bringing them back as a shepherd his flock....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tobit, in like manner, contemplates all men as coming
within the pale of God’s mercy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I exalt my God, and my soul shall rejoice in the King of heaven;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of His greatness let all men tell,</div>

<p>The belief of both writers concerning the future life is
identical, it follows the normal teaching of the Old Testament;
there is, therefore, no belief in the resurrection (see
Ecclus. xvii. 27, 28, xxviii. 6, xl. 11, etc., and Tobit iii.
10, iv. 10, xii. 9, xiii. 2); at the same time, one is perhaps
justified in seeing the foreshadowing of a developed belief
in such words as these: “Lord, command that I be released
from this distress, let me go to the everlasting place, and turn
not Thy face, O Lord, away from me” (Tobit iii. 6).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A definite doctrinal development is to be discerned in
two directions; while in a number of passages the doctrine
of God in each book is the same as normally taught in the
Old Testament, in Tobit there is a distinct tendency to
introduce the idea of an intermediate agency between God
and men; this is seen in the activity of the angel Raphael,
who is sent to fulfil God’s purposes, e.g. iii. 16, 17: “At
the self-same time the prayer of both was heard before the
glory of God; and Raphael was sent to heal them both; ...”
and in xii. 12-14 Raphael says: “And now, when thou
didst pray, and Sarah, I did bring the memorial of your
prayer before the glory of the Lord; and when thou didst
bury the dead, likewise....” It is also worth noting that
instead of speaking of God directly, expressions such as
“the glory of God” (as in the two passages just quoted),
and the “Name” (iii. 11, viii. 5, xi. 14, xii. 6, xiii. 18) are
used; stress is thus laid on the transcendental character
of God in a manner which reminds one of the later developments
of Judaism regarding this subject. Closely connected
with what has just been said is the developed doctrine of
angels in the Book of Tobit; in addition to the passages just
quoted reference may be made to xi. 14: “Blessed is God,
and blessed is His great name, and blessed are all His angels”;
and xii. 15: “I am Raphael, one of the seven angels, which
stand and enter before the glory of the Lord.” Such ideas
show a decided development of belief on the subject of angels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
as compared with the teaching of Ben-Sira, for in his book
there is scarcely any reference to angels, xlii. 16 (and,
possibly, xliii. 26) being the only one. It is the same with
the subject of demonology, which has no place in the teaching
of Ben-Sira, while in Tobit the references to Asmodæus
“the evil demon” (iii. 8, 17, cp. vi. 14) and to methods
of exorcism (vi. 7-9, 16-18, viii. 2, 3) show that belief in
the activity of demons had begun to assume a position of
considerable importance in popular superstition.</p>

<p>This comparison between the religious standpoint of
the writer of Tobit and that of Ben-Sira shows that there is
much affinity between the two, and leads to the conclusion
that, in the main, though not in all respects, both belong to
the same school of thought. We have seen that Ben-Sira
represented the point of view of those who may be regarded
as the precursors of what developed into the Sadducæan
party after the Maccabæan struggle. The writer of the
Book of Tobit approximates to this standpoint upon the
whole, though in some respects he inclines to other
directions. Loyalty to the Law and belief in Providence,
as we have pointed out in another chapter, are not
incompatible with the Sadducæan position; the prominent
stress laid on almsgiving and its efficacy (iv. 10, xii. 9)
does not differ from the teaching of Ben-Sira on the subject.
In his universalistic attitude, though like Ben-Sira an ardent
Israelite, the writer of Tobit follows in the teaching of the
greatest prophets, and in this differs fundamentally from
the standpoint of those who, later, developed into the party
of the Pharisees. That there is no teaching on the resurrection
in passages where one would justly look for it had
such a doctrine been held, points in the same direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the developed teaching on the transcendental
character of God, the angelology and demonology,
and the slight indications of the beginning of eschatological
teaching, point away from the position indicated. This fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
is full of interest as showing that prior to the Maccabæan
struggle no hard and fast lines were drawn between different
schools of thought, although definite tendencies were distinctly
observable. We are inclined to see in the writer of
the Book of Tobit a thinker whose natural tendency was to
follow in the wake of the old conservative school, but who was
not uninfluenced by the rising thought of the Apocalyptists
(see xiii. 1-18, xiv. 3-7), and who felt that much of what
was taught by the <em>Chassidim</em> was of permanent value. In
<em>Chassidism</em> were contained the germs<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> of what before long
developed into the Apocalyptic Movement and Pharisaism;
as long as these only remained tendencies there was nothing
fundamentally antagonistic in either, and in the writer of
the Book of Tobit we see this exemplified. This helps us,
by the way, to understand why we find later specifically
apocalyptic <em>traits</em> in Pharisaic teaching, and specifically
Pharisaic <em>traits</em> in Apocalyptic teaching; and this in spite
of the pronounced antagonism which in course of time arose
between the two. This fact is to be explained not so
much on the assumption that one influenced the other,
as that both descended from the same ancestor, viz.
<em>Chassidism</em>.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHII_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Book, its Integrity, and Place of
Origin</span></h4>

<p>From what has just been said we are led to the conclusion
that our book belongs to the same period as that of Ecclesiasticus,
though perhaps slightly later in that period than the
latter book. Its doctrinal standpoint, like that of Ecclesiasticus,
is pre-Maccabæan. That there is not the slightest
reference to the Maccabæan struggle points in the same
direction. Various reasons, some of them rather forced,
have been put forward to show that the book is of much later
date, others to prove that it is much earlier; but we feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
convinced that the surest guide to the date of a Jewish book
written between those two great historical landmarks, the
time of Ezra and the beginning of the Christian era, is its
doctrinal standpoint.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> This, taken as a whole, can in the
case of our book only point to a time previous to the Maccabæan
struggle; for, after this, parties antagonistic to each
other became definitely formed, and such an attitude as
that of the writer of the Book of Tobit was then unthinkable;
he must then have been either a Sadducee or a Pharisee or
an Apocalyptist (Essenism does not come into consideration
here), whereas, in point of fact, he shows a mixture of all
three tendencies. The book is not necessarily later than
Ecclesiasticus, for although it does in some respects show a
development of doctrine it is quite possible for contemporaries
to be in substantial agreement and yet for one to hold
slightly more advanced views on certain points than another.
Our book may thus be assigned to a date not much later
than <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 175 and not earlier than <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 190.</p>

<p>A careful study of the book shows no reason for questioning
its integrity; the author has obviously utilized different
materials in composing his story, but apart from minor
details, his composition has not been added to by other
writers.</p>

<p>The place of origin of the book cannot be decided with any
certainty; it lies between Palestine and Egypt, though the
balance of probability points to the latter. The book was
written for the Jews of the Dispersion; this is clear from such
words as the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give thanks unto Him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For He hath scattered you among them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And there He hath shown you His greatness;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And extol ye Him before all the living (xiii. 3, 4),</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the writer himself says he is in captivity in xiii. 6:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, in the land of my captivity, give Him thanks.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That this land cannot be either the Far East, Persia, Assyria,
Babylonia, or Media, as has been held by different scholars,
is shown by Simpson, who says that “such surmises are, at
the outset, negatived by the author’s ignorance of Eastern
geography and his acceptance of the ordinary standards of
Greek and Roman geographies. That the Tigris flowed
between Nineveh and Media was an idea common among the
Greeks; that Ecbatana was situated in a plain was a constant
Western fallacy, and is repeated in Diodorus ii. 13, 6,
in a passage dependent on Ctesias.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Another, apparently
small, point also suggests Egypt; it is said in vi. 3 that “a
great fish leaped up out of the water, and would have swallowed
the foot of the young man ...”; no ordinary fish
would do this kind of thing, it points rather to a crocodile
of the Nile, and this was probably in the writer’s mind;
“this conjecture,” in the words of Robertson Smith, “is
raised almost to certainty when we read in Kazwini i. 132
that the smell of the smoke of a crocodile’s liver cures
epilepsy, and that its dung and gall cure leucoma, which was
the cause of Tobit’s blindness. Very similar statements
as to the medicinal virtues of the crocodile occur in Greek
and Latin writers.”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>Further, the sources utilized by the writer of the book
suggest Egypt as the place of its origin; “only Egyptian
Jews could need an antidote to the <cite>Tractate of Khons</cite>,” and
this seems to have been one main purpose of the book.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
Finally, if, as seems upon the whole probable, the book was
originally written in Greek, a further reason for regarding
Egypt as its original home is offered. Some scholars are
strong advocates of a Semitic (Hebrew or Aramaic) original,
but to give details of the reasons for either contention would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
involve technicalities which would be inappropriate here.
It must suffice to say that the Greek as a whole does not read
like a translation, whatever may be the case in isolated
instances. If one reads the Greek of Ecclesiasticus, which
is admittedly a translation, and compares it with that of
the Book of Tobit, the difference is enormous, and forces
one to believe that if Tobit was originally written in Hebrew
or Aramaic, its Greek form must be not a translation, but a
paraphrase.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>It is, however, quite possible that the home of the writer
was Palestine, and that for some reason or other he was
compelled to spend some considerable time in Egypt. Ben-Sira’s
grandson, who was evidently a native of Palestine,
came into Egypt and continued there and issued his grandfather’s
book in a Greek form while living there. On the
supposition that the writer of Tobit was a native of Palestine
sojourning in Egypt the Aramaic traits in his book could be
explained in a quite natural way.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHII_VI">VI. <span class="smcap">The Value of the Book for New Testament Study</span></h4>

<p>There are a few passages in the Book of Tobit which, on
being compared with similar ones in the Gospels, illustrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
the truth that Christ inculcated much of the teaching of
Judaism with which His hearers were already familiar, and
which therefore had His approval. In iv. 8, 9 we read:
“As thy substance is, give alms of it according to thine
abundance; if thou have much, according to the abundance
therefore give alms; if thou have little, bestow it, and be
not afraid to give alms according to that little; for thou
layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day of
necessity.” The spirit of this teaching is endorsed, but
made more spiritual, in the familiar words of Matthew vi. 19-21:
“Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth ...
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven ... for where
thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.” An even
more pointed illustration is seen on comparing Tobit xii. 8-10
with Matthew vi. 1-6; the former runs: “Better is prayer
with truth, and alms with righteousness, than riches with
unrighteousness; it is better to give alms than to lay up
gold ...”; in Matthew vi. 1-6 almsgiving and prayer
are likewise placed together, only here again the teaching is
fuller and deeper. Again, in Tobit iv. 15 it is said: “What
thou thyself hatest, do to no man”; this negative
injunction is put positively in Matthew vii. 12: “All things
therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto
you, even so do ye also unto them” (cp. Luke vi. 31).
Once more, in Tobit iv. 16 the command is given: “Give
of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them
that are naked”; this reminds one irresistibly of Matthew
xxv. 35, 36: “I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I
was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye
took me in; naked, and ye clothed me....”</p>

<p>That St. Paul was well acquainted with the Book of
Tobit, and was influenced by it, seems to come out clearly in
some passages in his epistles; thus the words in 2 Corinthians
ix. 9, “Let each man do according as he hath purposed in
his heart; not grudgingly or of necessity,” echo what is said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
in Tobit iv. 7, 16, “As thy substance is ...” (quoted
above) and in verse 16: “Let not thine eye be grudging
when thou givest alms” (cp. 1 Cor. xvi. 2, 2 Cor. viii. 12).
Although the identical injunction is given in Tobit iv. 12<i>a</i>
and 1 Thessalonians iv. 3, and in Tobit iv. 15<i>b</i> and Ephesians
v. 18, they do not necessarily imply that St. Paul was
indebted to this book for them because they are so general
in character. On the other hand, the thought in Romans vi.
23, “For the wages of sin is death,” seems to be derived
from Tobit xii. 10: “They that commit sin and unrighteousness
are enemies to their own life.” In the first epistle to
Timothy the influence of our book may also be discerned
in a few cases; thus, in vi. 6 the words, “But godliness
with contentment is great gain,” are in their essence closely
analogous to what is written in Tobit iv. 21: “And fear not,
my child, because we have become poor; thou hast much
wealth, if thou fear God and avoid every kind of sin, and do the
things which are good in the sight of the Lord thy God.” In
the same way, the passage already quoted, Tobit iv. 9, “...
for thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the day
of necessity,” is spiritualized in 1 Timothy vi. 19: “... laying
up in store for themselves a good foundation against
the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which
is life indeed.” It is also worth mentioning that the expression
“King eternal” in 1 Timothy i. 17 occurs also in
Tobit xiii. 6.</p>

<p>In a few other passages identity of thought and verbal
similarities are of interest: the combination of good works
and almsdeeds is found in Tobit i. 3 and Acts ix. 36; in
Tobit xii. 12 the words, “I did bring the memorial of your
prayer before the glory of the Lord,” reminds one forcibly of
Acts x. 4: “Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up
for a memorial before God.” The idea of binding the devil
occurs both in Tobit viii. 3 and Revelation xx. 2, and the
description of the new Jerusalem in Tobit xiii. 16-18 has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
some distinct points of similarity with the fuller picture given
in Revelation xxi. 10-21.</p>

<p>In most of the cases given above the verbal similarity is
more striking when read in the original Greek.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHIII_I">I. <span class="smcap">Contents and Character of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The book purports to tell of events which took place
in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, “who reigned over
the Assyrians in Nineveh.” It tells of how this king in the
twelfth year of his reign gathered together many nations
to fight with him against the Medes; the collection of this
host seems to have taken five years, for it was not until the
seventeenth year of his reign that Nebuchadnezzar attacked
and conquered Arphaxad, king of the Medes. Now among
the peoples whom Nebuchadnezzar had summoned to join
him in this war all those of the west had refused to respond,
among them being those “that were in Carmel and Gilead,
in the higher Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon, all
that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, and beyond
Jordan unto Jerusalem” (i. 9); these and many others,
therefore, Nebuchadnezzar determined to punish now that
he had successfully dealt with the Medes. So he commands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
Holofernes, the chief captain of his host, to go with an army
of 132,000, and take vengeance on these disobedient lands of
the west. Then follows the account of Holofernes’ victorious
progress until he reaches the plain of Esdraelon; he
pitches his camp between Geba and Scythopolis, and rests
there for a month in order to “gather together all the baggage
of his host” (ii. 21-iii. 10). The Jews are now filled
with anxiety, and speedily set about taking measures of
defence; above all, they fortify the villages on the mountain-tops.
Joakim, the high-priest, takes the lead and
commands the people of Bethulia to seize the ascents of
the hill-country overlooking the plain of Esdraelon, “because
by them was the entrance into Judæa, and it was
easy to stop them from approaching, inasmuch as the
approach was narrow, with space for two men at the most”
(iv. 1-8). The people then give themselves to fasting and
prayers, calling upon God to help them in this hour of
danger (iv. 9-15). Holofernes, on hearing of the preparations
made to resist his advance, is greatly incensed. Then
Achior, the leader of the Ammonites who had joined the
Assyrian army, warns Holofernes, by pointing to the past
history of the Jews, that their God invariably helped these
people so long as they remained faithful to Him; so that
“if there is no lawlessness in their nation,” Achior concludes,
“let my lord now pass by, lest their Lord defend them,
and their God be with them, and we shall be a reproach
before all the earth.” Holofernes, however, resents this
warning, thinking that Achior’s intention is to protect the
Jews by thus seeking to dissuade him from further advance.
To punish Achior, Holofernes has him bound and taken to
the foot of the hill on which the fortress of Bethulia is
situated; he is left there in the hopes that he will be killed
by the enemy. But the Israelites, on finding him, take him
into the city and treat him kindly (v., vi.). Holofernes now
makes a demonstration in the valley in the sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
garrison in Bethulia, his object being to inspire the Jews
with dread and despair, and thus induce them to submit;
the capture of this mountain fortress was essential for the
further advance. But “the children of Esau” realize that it
is no easy matter to reduce an almost impregnable fortress
like this otherwise than through famine; above all, if the
water supply is cut off, the garrison will speedily be forced
to give in; “remain in thy camp,” they say to Holofernes,
“and keep safe every man of thy host, and let thy servants
get possession of the fountain of water which issueth forth
from the foot of the mountain; for all the inhabitants of
Bethulia have their water thence; and thirst will kill them,
and they will give up their city.” Holofernes sees the
wisdom of this advice, which is carried out. The result is
that the people in Bethulia suffer terrible distress, and are
reduced to despair; they come to Ozias, the elder of the
city, and call upon him to surrender; Ozias implores them
to hold out for another five days, firmly believing that
God will have mercy upon them and not forsake them
utterly. To this the people consent (vii.).</p>

<p>These first seven chapters, which constitute nearly half
the book, form in reality only the introduction to what
follows; the heroine of the story has not yet even been
mentioned. The writer has brought his narrative to a
point where, humanly speaking, nothing can save the ill-fated
people of Bethulia; but he leaves the impression upon
his hearers that they are to expect something wonderful
to happen during the five days of waiting for the end.
And, in truth, the story that follows is extraordinarily
dramatic; from chapter viii. onwards one is carried along in
almost breathless excitement, it is a masterpiece of narrative;
though the one thing that perhaps somewhat mars its
perfection is the writer’s proneness to be diffuse.</p>

<p>With chapter viii. Judith is introduced; first her genealogy
is given, she belongs to the tribe of Simeon; then other details<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
are mentioned. She has been a widow for three years
and four months; her husband, Manasses, died of sunstroke;
he had left his widow “gold, and silver, and menservants,
and maidservants, and cattle, and lands.” Judith is a
devout woman, and strict in her religious observances;
her great beauty is often insisted upon, and she is also
endowed with much wisdom. On her hearing of what had
happened, she sends her maid to the elders of the city,
Ozias, Chabris, and Charmis, inviting them to her house;
they come, and Judith addresses them at some length, the
gist of her words being that they have been wrong in promising
to deliver up the city in five days, because in doing so
they have shown their want of faith in God; moreover,
if Bethulia is taken it will mean the utter downfall of the
people, and the profanation of the sanctuary. So she urges
them to be an example to the people by showing unwavering
trust in God. They commend her words, and beg her to
pray to God for rain, that the cisterns may be filled and the
people obtain refreshment. But Judith replies: “Hear
me, and I will do a thing, which shall go down to all generations
among the children of our race.” She does not tell
them what she is going to do, but only says that God will
use her as an instrument of deliverance before the five days
are out (viii.). The whole of the next chapter is taken up
with Judith’s prayer to God in preparation for what she
is about to undertake. Judith now goes with her maid to
the camp of Holofernes; everyone is struck with her
beauty, and she is well received, Holofernes especially
being very gracious to her. She then declares to him the
purpose of her coming, which is for nothing less than the
betrayal of her people. She skilfully uses the argument
which Achior had used, namely that as long as her people
are faithful to God it will not be possible to overcome them,
but if they do anything to anger Him, then He will forsake
them. This, she tells him, is true; but what Achior did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
know, that she has come to tell, and it is this: the Israelites
are about to do something which will bring down upon
them the wrath of God; being in dire straits they are going
to eat sanctified food, which is contrary to the Law; they
are merely waiting to receive licence to do this from the
authorities in Jerusalem, where the same thing has already
been done, and as soon as they receive the permission they
will transgress the Law; then will be Holofernes’ chance.
So Judith says she will go forth each night, and will
pray to God Who will tell her as soon as the people have
committed their sins; “and I will come and show it
also unto thee; and thou shalt go forth with all thy host,
and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee.
And I will lead thee through the midst of Judæa,
until thou comest over against Jerusalem; and I will
set thy seat in the midst thereof.” Needless to say that
Holofernes is greatly pleased with these words. For three
days Judith and her maid remain in the camp within their
own quarters; each night they go forth to pray, the guards
being instructed to let them pass outside the camp (x.-xii. 9).
But on the fourth day Holofernes gives a feast to which
he invites Judith; she comes; the feast lasts long, and
Holofernes becomes inflamed with wine and casts evil eyes
upon Judith. Then all the servants go from the tent.
Judith and Holofernes are left alone; but the latter is overcome
with wine. Judith approaches the couch whereon
he lies; then uttering a hasty prayer for strength, she seizes
the warrior’s scimitar and hews his head from his body.
She calls her maid, who puts the head of Holofernes into her
bag of victuals, and they both pass out of the camp, and
return to Bethulia (xii. 10-xiii. 10). There is immense joy
in the city when they learn what Judith has done; the head
of Holofernes is hung out on the battlements. The Assyrian
army, on learning what has happened, are plunged into fear
and confusion; the Israelites fall upon them and put them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
to flight. Judith is richly rewarded, and honoured by all
the people (xiii. 11-xv. 13). Then follows Judith’s Song of
Praise (xvi. 2-17); and the book closes with a short account
of how Judith dedicated to God her share of the spoil of the
Assyrian camp, of her prosperity, and finally of her death in
Bethulia at a ripe old age (xvi. 18-25).</p>

<p>The first question as to the character of the book that
naturally arises is whether, or how far, it is historical. The
opening words of the book are in themselves sufficient to
show that the writer is not to be looked upon as a historian.
He says, “In the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,
who reigned over the Assyrians in Nineveh ...”; and again
in ii. 1 ff. it is narrated how in his eighteenth year he sent
Holofernes to undertake the campaign in the west. But
further, in iv. 2, 3 it says that the people were exceedingly
afraid at the approach of Holofernes, and were troubled for
Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God; “because
they were newly come up from the Captivity, and all
the people of Judæa were lately gathered together; and
the vessels, and the altar, and the house, were sanctified
after the profanation.” How utterly unhistorical all this
is can be seen at once by referring to 2 Kings xxiv., xxv., and
Jeremiah xxxix., xl. Nebuchadnezzar was king of <em>Babylon</em>
(Nineveh fell in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 608), and it was in the eighteenth year
of his reign (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 586) that Jerusalem was besieged and
captured for the second time, the first time being in 597;
and so far from the people having newly come up from the
Captivity, it was just in this year that a further exportation
of Jews took place. The return from the Captivity was, at
the earliest, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 536, the rebuilding of the Temple took
place some twenty years later. Then, again, in iv. 6-8 Joakim
the high-priest is represented as supreme ruler; but as a
matter of fact Gedaliah had been appointed by Nebuchadnezzar
as governor over the cities of Judah (2 Kings xxv. 22,
Jer. xl. 5).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span></p>

<p>On the face of it, therefore, the book is not to be regarded
as historical. Yet the writer is well acquainted with the
Old Testament, and so far as the geography of Palestine
is concerned he is thoroughly <i lang="fr">au fait</i>. We must conclude
that he simply chose the historical names and times as
the framework in which to place his story in order that he
might thereby render it more dramatic; he purposely
commits gross historical blunders in order to make it clear
to his readers at the outset that the historical period chosen
is merely for literary effect; “they are to understand that
this is fiction, not history; it did not take place in this or
that definite period of Jewish history, but simply ‘once
upon a time,’ the real vagueness of the date being transparently
disguised in the manner which has become familiar
in the folk-tales of other parts of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> There is, of
course, always the possibility that some historical basis
may exist for the actual story of Judith as distinct from
its framework, and this is held to be the case by some
scholars; Zunz, for example, says: “It is quite possible
that in some Palestinian town a popular festival might
have been celebrated in memory of the heroic deed of some
woman, and that when the real occasion of it had been
forgotten and had given place to a legend with manifold
embellishment, a story was composed in honour of Judith,
presumably before the destruction of the Temple.”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The
fact that several forms of the story exist supports this idea
(see the next section). But the majority of scholars are
disposed to regard the book as pure fiction (with a special
object in view as we shall see presently), and without any
basis of fact.</p>

<p>As a piece of literary work the book must command
sincere admiration; the author is a master in the art of
story-telling, and the way in which he intertwines the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
purposes for which the book was written with the narrative
itself is very skilfully done. Striking, too, is the dramatic
power which the writer exhibits; the reader becomes
fascinated as step by step he is drawn nearer and nearer to
the climax, wondering what it is going to be; he is impelled
to read on in order to see what is really going to happen, for
the writer cleverly conceals this right up to the very moment
that the climax is reached. Judith’s object in coming
to Holofernes seems to be represented at first as the act of
a traitress, and something worse; and yet her deep piety
convinces the reader that this cannot be; so that he must
read on; he cannot stop. Torrey is certainly right in saying
that “what gained for the book its high esteem in early
times, in both the Jewish and the Christian world, was its
intrinsic merit as a story, rather than its religious teaching
or its patriotism.”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIII_II">II. <span class="smcap">Variety of Form of the Judith Story</span></h4>

<p>Mention must be made of the fact that our book has come
down to us in more than one form. We have, firstly, the
Greek form preserved in the Septuagint; our Apocrypha
follows this, and it is the one of which some account has
been given in the preceding section. This Greek form of
the story is much longer than the other, to be spoken of
presently; but it exists in three recensions, and the differences
between these are considerable. Of these three, one
is preserved in the principal uncial manuscripts, A, B, and
to some extent in ℵ; this, as just said, is the recension
adopted in our Apocrypha. The second is found in two
cursive manuscripts, numbered 19 and 108; while the
third occurs in a cursive numbered 58<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>; it was from a
manuscript belonging to the type of text representing this
latter that the Old Latin and Syriac Versions were made.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
It is probable that all these recensions go back to a single
archetype.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> But, in the second place, there exists, in
Hebrew, quite a different and much shorter form of the
story; this form is preserved in a Hebrew manuscript, found
by Gaster,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> belonging approximately to the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1000;
its home was, according to Gaster, “somewhere in Babylon,”
and he believes that it “must have belonged originally to
the old Megillath Taanith,” a Rabbinical tractate belonging
to the Haggadic literature. In this shorter form some of the
essential features of the story differ from the longer form;
thus, Seleucus takes the place of Nebuchadnezzar; Judith
appears not as a widow, but as a maiden, the daughter of
Ahitob; the scene of the story, moreover, is not placed in
Bethulia, but in Jerusalem; and the relations between
Judith and her victim are given in somewhat unblushing
detail. This form of the story occurs also in the Megillath
Taanith (chap, vi.), as we now have it; here there are again
some variations, for, according to Zunz, “Judith is represented
as the daughter of Jochanan, or of Mattathiah, and
as a heroine belonging to the Hasmonæan period.”<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>The question naturally arises here as to which of these
forms most nearly represents the original story. The rather
intricate details which would have to be given in order to
answer this would be wearisome; we must content ourselves,
therefore, with saying that there can be little doubt that
the shorter, Hebrew, form must be regarded as coming
closest to the original form of the story. In comparing the
contents of each form, as given respectively in the Greek MSS.
and in the magazine in which Gaster’s manuscript has been
published, it will be seen that a variety of indications lead
to the conviction that the shorter form is the older.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Teaching and Purpose of the Book</span></h4>

<p>These two subjects go together; for the answer to the
one is the answer to the other. The teaching is that of the
rigidly orthodox Pharisaic type; observance of the Law
is the one thing needful. This is vividly brought out whenever
Judith’s piety is extolled; her strictness with regard
to the dietary laws is described in xii. 1-9 (see also x. 5,
xi. 12-15); when at last she sits down at the banquet of
Holofernes it is said: “She took and ate and drank before
him what her servant had prepared” (xii. 19). Her fasting
and observance of the feast-days is mentioned in viii. 6:
“And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the
eves of the sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the
new moons, and the new moons, and the feasts and joyful
days of the house of Israel” (cp. iv. 13). Ritual ablutions
are referred to in x. 3, xii. 7, 9, her devotion to prayer in the
whole of chapter ix., and incidentally in viii. 31, xi. 17,
xii. 6, xiii. 3, 4, 7, 10. It is strange that there is no reference
to almsgiving. Further, zeal for the Temple is shown in
iv. 2, 3, iv. 11-15, v. 19, viii. 21, 24, ix. 1, 8, 13, xvi. 20;
and the duty of mourning in viii. 5, 6, xvi. 24. The sin of
withholding their dues from the priests is emphasized in
xi. 13. Pharisaic particularism is to be discerned in viii. 20,
ix. 14, xvi. 17; proselytism in xiv. 10; and eternal punishment
on the Gentiles in xvi. 17. The worship of the One
God of Israel, and the teaching concerning Him, is of course
insisted upon throughout.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that, although much of the teaching
is that of traditional Judaism, certain specifically Pharisaic
doctrinal points stand out conspicuously; this, it may be
said in passing, makes our book important for the study of
pre-Christian Judaism.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the book is, therefore, clearly to
inculcate and to forward Pharisaic Judaism; and at the
time when this book was written (see the next section)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
this was extremely needful; for although there were some
things in the Pharisaic presentation of Judaism which were
not conducive to spiritual religion, it cannot be too strongly
insisted upon that Pharisaism was the one and only bulwark
against heathenism in those days, and the upholder
of a true monotheistic faith. It has been truly pointed out
by Elbogen<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> that “the Pharisees are usually described as
the party of narrow legalistic tendencies, and it is forgotten
how strenuously they laboured against the Hellenizing
movement for the maintenance of Monotheism; it is forgotten
that they built up religious individualism and purely
spiritual worship; that it was through them more especially
that belief in a future life was deepened; and that they
carried on a powerful mission (propaganda).”</p>

<p>Teaching of a different kind in our book, and of subsidiary
importance, is that where God’s honour is concerned His people
must fight, no matter how great the odds against them may
be. A warlike spirit breathes throughout the book; but it is
against the enemies of God, the heathen nations, that this
spirit is directed; so that it is the need and duty and glory
of religious warfare that is inculcated.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Book</span></h4>

<p>The historical details given in the book are, as we have
seen, wholly unreliable; they cannot, therefore, be of any
use in seeking to fix a date. In the absence of other indications
there is only one way in which this can be approximately
ascertained, and that is by the teaching and contents
of the book. But as has already been pointed out, the
form in which the story is given in the Apocrypha is not the
earliest; so that we must seek to establish dates both for
the form that we have here followed, namely, that of the
Apocrypha, and for the story as it appeared in its original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
form. We have shown that the teaching is that of the
Pharisaic type; now it is, as has been pointed out in an
earlier chapter,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> from the <em>Maccabæan conflict</em> with surrounding
heathenism that Pharisaism emerges as an active movement,
and it only becomes quiescent after the annihilation
of the Jewish national life in the reign of Hadrian<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>; this
gives two outside dates within which the book in either form
must have been composed, viz. roughly speaking between
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 150-<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 135. The book is first quoted in the first
epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians,<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> which was
written in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 95 or 96; this presupposes the existence
of our book for some time previously. But a further consideration
is this: the pseudepigraphic book called “The
Assumption of Moses,”<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> was written at the beginning of
the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> by a Pharisee whose purpose in writing
it was to urge upon the Jews quietude and patience instead
of a warlike spirit and national assertion; the writer of this
book belonged to the same party as the writer of the Book
of Judith in its later form; had both writers lived at the
same time it is highly improbable that they would have taken
up such entirely opposed attitudes on the question of religious
warfare; as there is no period during the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
the historical conditions of which would suit the warlike
spirit of our book, it is obvious that it must have been
written before the beginning of the Christian era. Gaster<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
has shown that there is only one period with which all the
elements of our book coincide so far as warfare is concerned,
and that is the approach of Pompey to Jerusalem in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
63. So that we may safely assign the middle of the first
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> as the date for the <em>later</em> form of our book, As
regards the earlier form of the book, it is to be noted that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
contains no references to ceremonial observances, a fact which
proves that it must have been written before Pharisaism
had had time to develop; this is of itself sufficient to show
that the book in its original form was written before <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
100; so that we shall not be far wrong in fixing the date of
this about the middle of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIII_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Original Language of the Book</span></h4>

<p>There can be no two opinions as to what the original
language of the book was, namely Hebrew; in numerous
instances the Greek proves itself to have been translated
from Hebrew, the idioms being those of classical Hebrew;
so that this was the original language of both the longer and
shorter forms. St. Jerome, in the preface to his translation,
says that he had the book before him in Aramaic; this
cannot, however, have been the original, for neither Origen
nor the Jews with whom he was in communication knew
either of a Hebrew or an Aramaic form of the book.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The
Hebrew original was lost altogether in the West, but must
have been preserved in some form or other in the East.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHIV_I">I. <span class="smcap">Preliminary Remarks</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">Before dealing with these Additions individually
a word may be said about them collectively. None
of them occur in the Hebrew Bible and in only one manuscript
of the Septuagint proper are they found<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>; but in the
great uncials (B, A, Q), which contain Theodotion’s Version
of the Septuagint, they all appear as integral parts of the text
of Daniel. “In the Greek manuscripts no break or separate
title divides these Greek additions from the rest of the text,
except that when Daniel is divided into ‘visions,’ the first
vision is made to begin at i. 1, Susanna being thus excluded
from the number; Bel, on the other hand, is treated as the
last of the visions.”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> What the actual number of Additions
originally was is uncertain; they are usually reckoned as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
three; it is possible, however, that five originally separate
pieces were incorporated into the text of the Septuagint,
viz. the Story of Susanna, the Prayer of Azariah, a short
narrative piece, the Song of the Three Children, and Bel
and the Dragon. The second, third and fourth of these are
usually regarded as forming one piece; this question we
shall consider immediately. Although some of these
Additions are quite inappropriate in their present context,
they have from very early times been regarded as belonging
to the Book of Daniel proper; “from the Fathers it is clear
that in the earliest Christian copies of the Septuagint both
Susanna and Bel formed part of Daniel, to which they are
ascribed by Irenæus and Tertullian, and implicitly by
Hippolytus. The remarkable letter of Julius Africanus to
Origen which throws doubt on the genuineness of Susanna,
calling attention to indications of its Greek origin, form a
solitary exception to the general view; even Origen labours
to maintain their canonicity.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Clement of Alexandria also
apparently regarded Susanna<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and the Song of the Three
Children<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and Bel<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> as canonical; and a string of other
authorities could be cited. A useful collection of references
to and quotations from these Additions in early Christian
writings is given by Daubney, <cite>The Three Additions to Daniel</cite>,
pp. 76-80, 163-169, 235-239.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIV_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Prayer of Azariah</span></h4>

<p>This addition consists of two pieces: a narrative portion,
verses 1, 23-27, and the Prayer itself, verses 2-22. Now in
the Aramaic of Daniel iii. 23, 24 the text runs: (23) “And
these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell
down in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. (24) Then
Nebuchadnezzar, the king, <ins class="corr" id="tn-386" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'was astonied, and'">
was astonished, and</ins> rose up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
haste....” Any candid reader must see at once that
there is something not in order with the text here; the
natural sequence of the text would, one might justly expect,
give some reason for Nebuchadnezzar’s astonishment before
stating the fact. Something has evidently fallen out of the
text after verse 23. If we insert after verse 23 of the canonical
Daniel the narrative addition found in the Septuagint
(Theodotion’s Version) we get the following:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell
down in the midst of the burning fiery furnace. <em>And they walked
in the midst of the fire, singing the praise of God, and blessing the Lord.
And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the furnace
hot with naphtha, pitch, tow, and small wood; so that the flame streamed
forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. And it spread and
burned those Chaldæans whom it found about the furnace. But the
angel of the Lord came down into the furnace together with Azarias
and his fellows, and he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace;
and he made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling
wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled
them.</em> Then Nebuchadnezzar, the king, was astonied, and rose
up in haste; he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast
three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and
said unto the king, True, O king. He answered and said, Lo,
I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have
no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</p>
</div>

<p>The words printed in italics are from the Septuagint, the
rest from the canonical Daniel. There are two things that
strike us here: firstly, we get the reason for Nebuchadnezzar’s
astonishment; and secondly, we are told how it was that
four instead of three men were seen in the furnace. The
reference to the fourth person in the furnace, as given in the
canonical text, is abrupt; that will be allowed. The whole
narrative, as just given, runs smoothly and naturally. We
contend, therefore, that this narrative addition of the Septuagint
represents—it may not be the exact translation—an
original portion of the canonical Daniel. It will be remarked
that part of the addition, namely that which refers to the
burning of the Chaldæans, is already represented in verse 22<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
of the canonical Daniel, viz., “the flame of the fire slew those
men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego”;
but these words do not occur in the one manuscript, mentioned
above, of the Septuagint proper which we possess,
nor in Theodotion’s Version; they are added in the Alexandrian
manuscript, but are evidently a later addition as
this manuscript also contains the reference to the Chaldæans
as given in the quotation above.</p>

<p>Turning now to the Prayer itself, we notice first that there
is nothing in it which connects it with the episode to which
it is supposed to belong; the words of verse 2, which introduce
the Prayer, viz. “Then Azarias rose up and prayed thus,
and opened his mouth in the midst of the fire and said,”
are an expansion made in order to give it an appearance
of connection with verse 1; probably the words ran originally:
“Then Azarias rose up and prayed thus,” or something
to this effect. The Azarias here mentioned is not one
of the “Three Children”; moreover, if the Prayer had
originally been written in reference to them we should
expect it to have been put into the mouth of Hananiah
(Ananias), i.e. the equivalent of the Aramaic Shadrach,
whose name is always placed first.</p>

<p>That the Prayer was composed during the early part of the
Maccabæan struggle seems probable for the following
reasons: in verse 5 it says, “In all the things that Thou
hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers,
even Jerusalem, Thou hast executed true judgements; for
according to truth and justice hast Thou brought all these
things upon us because of our sins.” The nation has thus
suffered adversity. In verse 9 it says further: “And
Thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies,
and most hateful forsakers of God, and to a king unjust
and the most wicked in all the world.” These “lawless
enemies” who are “most hateful forsakers of God” are the
extreme Hellenistic Jews mentioned in 1 Maccabees i. 11-15;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
and by the “king unjust and the most wicked in all the
world” is meant Antiochus Epiphanes (cp. 1 Macc. i.
20-24, 41-64). The sore plight in which the nation found
itself is shortly but graphically described in verses 14, 15;
“For we, O Master, have been made less than all the nations,
and are brought this day in all the world because of our sins.
Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader,
or burnt-offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or
place to offer before Thee and to find mercy.” This
certainly describes the state of affairs in Palestine at the
beginning of the Maccabæan struggle; the date of the composition
would, therefore, be about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 170; and the
passages quoted read like the words of one who lived in
Palestine. The indications in the Prayer of its having been
originally written in Hebrew<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> would point in the same
direction.</p>

<p>The conjecture may be hazarded that in its original form
it was in no way connected with the Book of Daniel; it was
inserted, before the Greek translation was made, because
its author happened to have the same name as one of the
heroes in the Daniel story; but since some copies of Daniel
must have existed which did not contain this addition
there was a doubt as to whether it had any right to a place
there. The canonical Daniel and the Septuagint represent
respectively these two opinions.</p>

<p>With the Prayer should be compared Daniel ix. 4-19 and
Baruch i. 15-iii. 8; all three partake of a liturgical character;
this becomes abundantly clear if one reads them in
connection with certain portions of the modern Jewish
Liturgy (“Morning Prayer,” see Singer’s edition, <cite>The
Authorized Daily Prayer Book</cite>, pp. 37 ff.). It is difficult
to get away from the conviction that all three of the pieces
just mentioned were in some way connected with the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
Jewish Liturgy; whether extracts from time-honoured
prayers, or based upon these, it is of course impossible to
say, but they quite distinctly breathe the Jewish liturgical
spirit.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIV_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Song of the Three Children</span></h4>

<p>This Song is introduced with the words of verse 28: “Then
the three, as out of one mouth, praised, and glorified, and
blessed God in the furnace saying”; thus the connection
with the “Three Children” is brought about. In verse 66,
at the conclusion of the Song, another connecting link is
brought in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless ye the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sing His praise and highly exalt Him for ever.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For He hath rescued us from Hades, and saved us from the power of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And delivered us from the midst of the burning fiery furnace, even out of the fire hath He delivered us.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A concluding doxology (verses 67, 68) is added. It is probable
that all these three verses form a later addition.</p>

<p>This Song again, apart from the added verses, has nothing
in it which would connect it with the “Three Children.”
Its tone of exultation is in strong contrast to the despondent
tone of the Prayer; this is, however, one indication of the
date of its composition, though a negative one, viz., it cannot
have been written during the Maccabæan struggle. It
cannot, on the other hand, have been written before this
struggle as the advanced belief in the future life taught in
verse 64 precludes this; that verse runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sing His praise, and highly exalt Him for ever.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We must, therefore, date it after the Maccabæan struggle,
probably soon after, on account of its jubilant tone. Like
the Prayer, this Song was written in Hebrew, though the
arguments for a Greek original in both cases cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
lightly dismissed. Why it came to be placed in its present
position can be quite naturally accounted for; it was due
to the desire to put into the mouth of the Three Children a
hymn of blessing and glory to God for their wonderful
deliverance. It must have been put into its present place
subsequently to the Prayer, but as regards its further history
one must hazard a conjecture similar to that mentioned
above in reference to the Prayer. It is also highly probable
that, like the Prayer, the Song was used in public worship.
For the <em>form</em> in which it is composed one should compare
two liturgical pieces preserved in the modern Jewish Liturgy,
viz. the “Abinu Malkenu” (Our Father, our King)<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> and
the “Order of counting the Omer”<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>; both differ wholly in
content from that of the Song, but the liturgical form is
similar in each case. See also the “Psalm of Thanksgiving”
which occurs in Ecclesiasticus li. after verse 12 (only preserved
in the Hebrew), and compare with it the “Shemoneh ‘Esreh”
in the Jewish Liturgy (Singer, <i>Op. cit.</i>, pp. 44 ff.).<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> That
the Song, when one remembers its history—and if we are
right in believing that it was at one time used in public
worship by the Jews—has been incorporated into the
English Church Liturgy seems to be only in the fit and natural
order of things.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIV_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Story of Susanna</span></h4>

<p>The position of this addition varies in the manuscripts;
in some it precedes the first chapter of the canonical Daniel;
this is the case in the uncials, while in the one manuscript
extant of the Septuagint proper which contains it, it forms
chapter xiii. of that book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></p>

<p>The story is briefly as follows: Susanna was the daughter
of a Jew dwelling in Babylon, named Joakim; she was
beautiful and devout. Among Joakim’s friends were two
elders of the people who were judges; these two were
frequent visitors at the house of Joakim. They both fell in
love with Susanna, unbeknown to each other; but each
was detected by the other one morning when they had gone
out into the garden where Susanna was wont to bathe.
They, therefore, agreed to act together in their wicked design;
but on approaching Susanna they were repulsed by her with
indignation, and in order to protect themselves they accused
her of having been unfaithful to her husband by admitting
a young man secretly into the garden. This accusation
they bring against her in the public court. As Susanna has
no means of proving her innocence she is, according to the
Law, condemned to death. On her way to execution the
crowd is separated by a young man named Daniel, who
maintains that Susanna’s condemnation is due to false
witness; and, basing his demand on the Law, insists that
there shall be anew trial.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> At this new trial the young man
Daniel examines the two witnesses, and asks each separately
under which tree in the garden the crime of which they accuse
Susanna took place; one says, under a mastick tree, the
other, under a holm tree. This contradiction reveals their
falseness, and they are condemned. “So when they had
gagged them, they led them out and hurled them into a
chasm; then the angel of the Lord cast fire in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
of them. And thus was innocent blood kept safe on that
day” (verse 62<i>a</i>, Septuagint).</p>

<p>The purpose which the writer of this story had in view is
reflected in the quotation given above from the Mishna,
Sanhedrin vi. 2, where two points are specially emphasized,
namely, that a criminal who has been condemned is to have
every chance of clearing himself, even up to the very end;
and that adequate witness must be forthcoming before an
accused man may be condemned. In fact the passage
referred to is one of several others which could be given
implying that a reform in the administration of justice
had at one time taken place among the Jewish authorities.
Ball, following Brüll,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> shows, in the admirable introduction
to his commentary on this book, that this reform was
instituted at the instance of Simon ben Shetach who lived
during the reigns of Alexander Jannæus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 103-76) and
Alexandra<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 76-67); it consisted, firstly, in the institution
of a proper examination of witnesses; in the Mishna,
Pirqe Aboth i. 9 it is said: “Simon ben Shetach used to
say, Examine the witnesses abundantly, and be cautious
in thy words, lest they learn from them to give false
answers.” But Simon ben Shetach was also, in the words of
Ball, “the champion of another reform in connection with
the law of testimony. As the brother-in-law of king
Alexander Jannæus, he was able, after a long struggle, to
secure the triumph of his party, the Pharisees, in the Sanhedrin,
and of their principles in the administration of the
Law, over their opponents, the Sadducees.... According
to Sadducæan principles, they who had falsely accused a
man of a capital crime were only put to death if the sentence
had already been executed on their victim. The legal
aphorism, ‘life for life,’ was construed literally. The
Pharisees, on the other hand, relying on Deuteronomy xix.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
19,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> considered the <em>intention</em> of the accusers as equivalent
to actual murder. According to them, the maxim ‘life
for life’ came into application as soon as, in consequence of
the false depositions, sentence had been pronounced, although
not yet carried out. The law at the time extraordinarily
favoured informations. The witnesses, who were also the
accusers, were only examined about the main fact, so that
their falsehood could not easily become evident; and even
if it did, they got off without punishment, though the accused
had actually been executed. This crying evil the Pharisaic
party sought to remedy by the introduction of a more rigorous
examination of witnesses, and by making the law more
severe against false witnesses.” The author’s aim, therefore,
in writing this book, was to show, by means of a story,
that the administration of justice was in some most
important particulars defective, and to put forth the Pharisaic
suggested reform as the proper remedy.</p>

<p>The questions of authorship, date, place of writing, and
language, are all practically answered by what has been
said; it was written by a Pharisee, during the last quarter
of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, in Jerusalem (or, at any rate, in
Palestine); the language was in all probability Hebrew.</p>

<p>The judicial acumen of the “young man” who examined
the false witnesses, and upon whom “a spirit of discernment”
(verse 45, Septuagint) was bestowed, was probably the
reason of the name of Daniel (“My judge is El”) being given
to him. Thus would sufficiently explain why it became
prefixed, or added, to the Book of Daniel, with which it
has otherwise no connection.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIV_V">V. <span class="smcap">Bel and the Dragon</span></h4>

<p>This addition follows the preceding one in all the Greek
manuscripts by which it is treated as an integral part of the
canonical Daniel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span></p>

<p>The story tells how Daniel proved to the king (called
“Cyrus the Persian” in Theodotion’s Version, but not
specified by name in the Septuagint manuscript) that the
Babylonian idol Bel was not a living god. The king is
convinced that Daniel is mistaken, and as proof thereof
points to the food which the god demolishes daily. But
Daniel undertakes to show the king that not Bel, but his
priests, with their wives and children, are those who daily
consume the food which they place before him. Daniel
and the king, then, go into the temple and watch the food
being set before Bel; thereupon the king’s seal is set upon
the entrance to the temple, but not before Daniel has
managed to get the ashes of wood strewn all over the floor of
the temple. During the night the priests with their families
enter the temple, as is their wont, by secret doors and enjoy
the food set before Bel. The next morning the king,
accompanied by Daniel, enter the temple; the king, seeing
the footprints of men, women and children in the ashes
on the floor, realizes the fraud of which he has been the
victim, and which has now been exposed by the wisdom of
Daniel. The image of Bel is destroyed, and his priests put
to death.</p>

<p>There follows then the exploit of Daniel with the dragon.
Daniel had scoffed at Bel because he had been made of clay
and bronze; but this god, as the king says, “liveth, and
eateth, and drinketh.” However, Daniel undertakes to
kill this living god without sword or staff, and thus prove
that he is no god. So he takes pitch, and fat and hair,
and makes lumps of them, and puts them into the dragon’s
mouth; the dragon eats them and bursts asunder. The
king is convinced. But the populace threaten to rise against
him unless he delivers unto them the destroyer of their
gods. The king gives way; and Daniel, being delivered
up, is cast into a den of lions. After remaining in the den
for six days, without being touched by the lions, Habakkuk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
(presumably the prophet of that name is intended) brings
him his dinner, having been conveyed by an angel from
Palestine to Babylon for this purpose. Finally, Daniel is
released by the king, at whose order those who would have
brought about his destruction are cast into the den of lions
and devoured instead.</p>

<p>The purpose of this addition is obviously to throw ridicule
on idolatry; although the story is somewhat puerile it
may well reflect forms of idolatry which obtained not only
in Babylon in earlier days, but also among the Gentiles at
the time when the author lived (about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 100, or a little
earlier); that is to say that both images and living animals
were worshipped. By the “dragon” is probably meant
a serpent<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>; we know that serpents were kept at Greek
shrines; for example, in the temple of Aesculapius at
Epidaurus,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and elsewhere, and were, therefore, probably
objects of worship.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> The writer of this addition may likely
enough have had this kind of idolatry in mind when speaking
of the “dragon.” That Daniel slaying the “dragon” was
intended to be a reference to the myth of Merodach and his
conflict with Tiamat seems highly improbable, for the addition
is clearly a philippic against idolatry, and there would
be no point in referring to this primeval combat. As it is
not likely to have been written for Jews, the original language
was probably Greek; there is nothing in the composition
which indubitably stamps it as having been translated from
a Semitic original. We are inclined to regard it as belonging
to the same type of literature as the Sibylline Oracles, and
written for the purpose of Jewish propaganda; cp. verse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
28, “The king has become a Jew,” and verse 41, “And
the king cried out and said, Great is the Lord God, and there
is no other god beside Him.” The universalistic attitude
of the writer, and his silence about the Law, the sacrifices,
and the priesthood, also point in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>As the author chooses Babylon as the scene of his story, it
is not unnatural that he should make Daniel his hero; this
would account for the addition having subsequently been
appended to the Book of Daniel.</p>

<p>The verses 33-39<i>a</i>, which introduce the Habakkuk episode,
are probably from some legend regarding the prophet of
that name; they have been ineptly inserted here; the
narrative reads far better without them, viz.: (verse 32)
“And Daniel was in the lion’s den six days; (verse 39<i>b</i>)
but the Lord God remembered Daniel....”</p>

<p>It would be hazardous to attempt to assign any particular
place as the home of this addition, beyond saying that, if
we are correct in supposing that the little composition was
written for propagandist purposes, it is more likely to have
been written somewhere in the Dispersion than in Palestine.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHV_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Nature and Object of the Additions</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">In the canonical Book of Esther the story is told of
how Ahasuerus, king of Persia, dismissed his queen,
Vashti, because she refused to obey his commandment to
come and show her beauty to his assembled guests at a
festival. In her place the king chose Esther, a Jewish
maiden belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, to be his
queen. Esther was of the Jewish exiles living in Persia,
and was under the protection of her cousin Mordecai; but
she “had not showed (it to) her people, nor her kindred; for
Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.”
In consequence of the position now occupied by his cousin,
Mordecai came to court every day in order to watch over
her interests. On one occasion he was the means of saving
the king, all unconscious, from assassination; this was
duly told to the king by Esther. But Mordecai had the
misfortune to offend Haman, the king’s chamberlain; in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
consequence of this Haman represented the Jews to the
king as a turbulent and disloyal people. The result was
that the king issued a proclamation according to which
the Jews were to be plundered and massacred. The day for
this Haman fixed by lot (“they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
before Haman from day to day,” iii. 7). Esther, persuaded
by Mordecai, resolves to save her people. She invites the
king and Haman to a banquet. On the night preceding the
banquet, the king, being unable to sleep, orders the national
records to be brought to him; in reading these he comes
across the account of Mordecai’s service in saving the king
from assassination; this the king had presumably forgotten,
for Mordecai had never been rewarded. In the meantime,
Haman, secure of favour, resolves upon the immediate
death of Mordecai; he has a gallows made, fifty cubits
high, on which he intends to hang Mordecai, and he goes
to the king at once to get permission to do so. On entering
into the king’s presence, Ahasuerus says to him: “What
shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to
honour?” Haman, thinking that the king has him in mind,
says that such a man should have royal apparel, and the
king’s horse to ride upon, and should ride through the city,
attended by one of the great nobles, to receive the people’s
homage. Thereupon the king orders Haman to attend
upon Mordecai in such a procession; this he has perforce
to do. The next day Esther gives her banquet; Ahasuerus
and Haman hear for the first time that she is a Jewess.
She then asks the king that Haman may be hanged on the
gallows he has prepared for Mordecai; her request is granted,
and Mordecai becomes the king’s chamberlain in his stead.
The king issues another proclamation, at Esther’s request,
in which power is granted to the Jews to pillage and slay
their enemies. Finally the feast of Purim is instituted
“because Haman ... the enemy of all the Jews, had
devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy
them....” (ix. 24-32).</p>

<p>It has been necessary to give this outline of the contents
of the canonical Book of Esther in order to show the point
of the additions in the Septuagint; for as found in the
English Apocrypha the additions are taken together and
treated as one whole; but by being thus separated from their
contexts their <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> is not seen. In the Septuagint
the additions form elaborations of certain passages of the
canonical Esther; so that in order to see the object of the
additions each must be considered from the point of view
of its original position.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>(1) The first addition is given in the English Apocrypha
as xi. 2-xii. 6; in the Septuagint it precedes chapter i.,
and takes the form of an introduction to the whole story.
It tells of how Mordecai had a dream, which he interpreted
as a revelation of the fact that an attempt was going to be
made upon the king’s life (see ii. 21-23 in the canonical
Esther). He tells the king of the threatened danger; he
watches those whom the dream has revealed as the culprits,
and overhears them while making their plans; he
then denounces them to the king, and the conspirators,
having confessed their guilt, are executed. Mordecai is
promoted to a place of honour at court.</p>

<p>The object of this addition is, therefore, to show how
Mordecai first got advancement at the court of Artaxerxes
(Ahasuerus).</p>

<p id="R-2">(2) The second addition is given in the English Apocrypha
as xiii. 1-7, which in the Septuagint comes between verses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
13 and 14 of chapter iii. This purports to give <i lang="la">verbatim</i> the
letter sent by Artaxerxes to the governor of the provinces
commanding the massacre of the Jews. In the canonical
Esther iii. 13 runs: “And the letters were sent by post
unto all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, to cause
to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and
women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the
twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the
spoil of them for a prey”; then follows the addition of the
Septuagint. In the letter the king tells of how it had been
his wish ever since he came to the throne to see his people
living in quietude and peacefulness; but that, according
to information he has received from Haman, this has not
been possible of attainment because of “a certain malignant
people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually
set aside the commandments of kings, so as the uniting
of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us, cannot go
forward.” The command is then given to exterminate
these people in order that the affairs of the kingdom can be
settled.</p>

<p>The object of this addition is evidently to emphasize
the peril in which the Jews were owing to the machinations
of Haman. Another object may also have been to show
the high favour which Haman enjoyed (he is spoken of as
one “that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved
by his constant goodwill and steadfast fidelity”) in order
to place his ignominious downfall in more pronounced
relief.</p>

<p>(3) The next addition (xiii. 8-xiv. 19 in the English
Apocrypha) comes after iv. 17 of the canonical Esther.
It contains a prayer of Mordecai (xiii. 8-17), a prayer of
Esther (xiv. 1-19), and one verse (xiii. 18) which says
that all Israel also prayed to God; these are prayers for
deliverance from the danger hanging over the people of
Jehovah in view of the king’s letter. These prayers breathe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
a spirit of deep devotion and loyalty to God. The object
of this addition is obvious; it is that the utter lack of
religion in the canonical book<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> should be made good; as
is well known, the name of God does not occur a single time
in the canonical Esther.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth addition (xv. 1-16 in the English Apocrypha)
follows immediately after the preceding one. This is an
elaboration of v. 1, 2 of the canonical Esther, which verses are
omitted in the Septuagint; it recounts in detail Esther’s
appearance before the king for the purpose of inviting him
to the banquet as mentioned in v. 3 ff. of the canonical book.
The object of this addition is similar to that of the
preceding; it is to show that the success of Esther’s interview
with the king was due to “the all-seeing God and
Saviour,” upon Whom she called before setting forth.</p>

<p>(5) This addition (xvi. 1-24 in the English Apocrypha)
comes after viii. 12 of the canonical Esther; it purports to
give the contents of the letter of Artaxerxes (see viii. 8 ff.
of the canonical Esther) written to revoke the order given
in the former one (<a href="#R-2">see (2)</a>). Here the object is twofold;
in the first place it is, once more, to give a religious tone to
the book; the king speaks of those who try to escape
“the evil-hating justice of God”; he says that the Jews
are the “children of the most high and most mighty living
God, Who hath ordered the kingdom both unto us and to
our progenitors in the most excellent manner”; and in
other ways he gives due honour to God by what he says.
Secondly, another object of the addition seems to be to
mitigate the rather bloodthirsty spirit of the canonical
Esther.</p>

<p>(6) The last addition (but first in <em>position</em> in the English
Apocrypha, x. 4-xi. 1) comes at the end of the book in the
Septuagint; x. 4-13 contain the interpretation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
dream given in addition which we have numbered (1). This
last addition, too, has the object of giving a more religious
tone to the book; “these things are of God,” is the way
in which the interpretation of the dream is introduced; and
the fact that the name of God is mentioned nine times in
as many verses amply illustrates the purpose of the addition.
xi. 1 is a note added to the last addition which is
intended to explain how the “Letter of Purim” (by which
is meant the whole book of Esther with the additions)
was brought to Egypt; but, as Swete says: “the historical
value of the book is more than doubtful.”<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHV_II">II. <span class="smcap">Authorship and Date of the Additions</span></h4>

<p>That the author, or, perhaps more probably, the authors
of these additions were Hellenistic Jews is sufficiently clear
from the whole tone of them; a striking example of detail
is that Artaxerxes is made to say that both he and his
forefathers had received their kingdom from God. As to
the date at which the additions were made there is nothing
in the additions themselves which offers any clue; but
a book, such as the canonical Esther, in which a wonderful
deliverance of the Jews is recorded, would be especially
welcome to the people during a time of stress and
anxiety; and if, at a time when such a book might
well have been eagerly sought after, patriotic Jews should
have enhanced its lesson of hope and encouragement by
adding explanatory details, such a procedure would have
been in the highest degree natural. There is but one period
of stress and anxiety that can come into consideration
here, and that is the time of the Maccabæan struggle;
so we conclude that these additions must have been made
during the latter half of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></span></p>

<h4 id="PII_CHVI_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Contents of the Prayer</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The Prayer is a beautiful one, finely constructed,
full without being drawn out, and breathing throughout
deep personal religion. It is certainly one of the best
pieces in the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>After the invocation to God Almighty, “the God of our
fathers, of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and of their
righteous seed,” comes an acknowledgement of His power
and glory; all things tremble before His might, and His
wrath against sinners is unendurable; yet His mercy is
without limit to the repentant: “Thou art the Lord
Most High, of great compassion, long-suffering and abundant
in mercy, and repentest Thee for evils of men,” i.e. God
in His pity relents because of the sufferings of men, even
though brought on them by their own sins. God is then
called upon to fulfil His promise of forgiveness to His
repentant servant. The supplicator confesses his manifold
sins, and protests his sense of unworthiness: “I am not
worthy to behold and see the height of heaven by reason of
the multitude of mine iniquities.” Then after further
confession of sin, and pleading with God to put away His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
anger and to show His mercy in forgiveness, the Prayer
concludes with the words: “And I will praise Thee for
ever all the days of my life; for all the host of heaven doth
sing Thy praise, and Thine is the glory for ever and ever.
Amen.”</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVI_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Origin of the Prayer</span></h4>

<p>In 2 Chronicles xxxiii. 12, 13 it is said that when Manasseh
“was in distress he besought the Lord his God,
and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
And he prayed unto Him; and He was entreated of him,
and heard his supplication, and brought him again unto
Jerusalem unto his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that
the Lord He was God.” Again, in verses 18, 19 of the same
chapter the chronicler says: “Now the rest of the acts of
Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of
the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord, the
God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of
the kings of Israel. His prayer also, and how God was
entreated of him ... behold, they are written in the history
of Hozai.”<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> The “Prayer of Manasses,” it is usually
held, purports to be the prayer to which the chronicler
refers; Ball, for example, says: “It is evident from the
references in 2 Chronicles xxxiii. 18, 19 that a prayer of
Manasseh, written in Hebrew, lay before that writer [i.e. the
chronicler]; and we may perhaps venture to add that there
is nothing in the form or substance of the Prayer before us
which can fairly be alleged against the possibility of its
having been ultimately derived from that lost Hebrew
original.... We incline to think that the Greek is a free
translation from some lost Haggadic narrative, which
was itself perhaps founded upon the older document from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
which the chronicler derived his peculiar details of the
history of Manasseh.”<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> This is an attractive theory,
but there are some objections to it which will appear as we
proceed. Ryle offers an entirely different hypothesis as
to its origin: “It is easy to understand that the chronicler’s
story of Manasseh’s repentance and prayer, and deliverance
from captivity must have produced upon the minds of
devout Jews a profound impression. The record of his
idolatry and of his persecution of the servants of Jehovah
had stamped his name with infamy in the annals of Judah.
But side by side with his wickedness were commemorated
the unusual length of the king’s reign and the quiet peacefulness
of his end. The chronicler’s story of the repentance
and conversion of Manasseh provided an explanation of a
seemingly unintelligible anomaly. Henceforth his name
was associated by Jewish tradition not only with the grossest
acts of idolatry ever perpetrated by a king of Judah, but
also with the most famous instance of Divine forgiveness
towards a repentant sinner. What more remarkable
example could be found of the long-suffering compassion of
the Almighty, and of His readiness to hear and to answer
the supplication of a contrite penitent? Nothing would be
more natural than for a devout Jew to endeavour to frame
in fitting terms the kind of penitential prayer, which, according
to the tradition, Manasseh had poured forth when he
was in captivity in Babylon. The sentiments embodied
in such a form of petition might conceivably be appropriate
to those of his countrymen who had fallen into idolatry,
and who might yet be reclaimed from the error of their
way.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Here again, one feels the strength of the argument;
but we cannot help believing that there are reasons which
militate against the acceptation of this hypothesis <em>as a
whole</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, the “Prayer of Manasses” does not
belong to the Septuagint proper; it occurs in Cod. A,
and in the much later Cod. T which follows the former and
is not independent evidence<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>; but in these it is given at the
end of the Psalms in a collection of liturgical canticles.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
As Ryle says: “The preservation of this short disconnected
Psalm may thus, with good reason, be ascribed to the accident
of its occurrence in the <cite>Didascalia</cite><a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and the <cite>Apostolical
Constitutions</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> There is no evidence to show that it was
ever included in the Septuagint.”<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> If it had been ascribed
to Manasseh when first composed we might rightly, on the
analogy of the Additions to Esther and to Daniel, expect
that it would have been incorporated in the text of Chronicles;
that this is not the case suggests, if nothing more,
that the name of Manasseh was not originally connected
with the Prayer. With the exception of two short sentences
there is absolutely nothing in the Prayer which is not
appropriate in the mouth of any repentant sinner. These
two sentences both occur in verse 10; the first runs: “I am
bowed down with many iron bands”; and the second is:
“I have set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable
things.” These sentences might well refer to Manasseh’s
imprisonment and to his idolatrous practices. But regarding
the former, it is very questionable whether the words are
to be taken literally, as though referring to 2 Chronicles
xxxiii. 11, where mention is made of the chains wherewith
Manasseh was bound; for the context, in the Prayer,
which speaks of transgressions and “the multitude of
mine iniquities,” strongly suggests that the “many iron
bands” is to be understood metaphorically of the chains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
sin. That the words were so understood in early times is
proved by the rendering of the Ethiopic Version, quoted
by Ball, which reads here: “I have laboured in fetters of
iron,” and continues, “that I might get rest from sin for
my soul; but by this also I have not gotten rest.” The
first of the sentences under consideration, therefore, would
be appropriate in the mouth of any contrite sinner, and
therefore does not by any means necessarily refer to
Manasseh. With regard to the second sentence, “I have
set up abominations, and have multiplied detestable things,”
the reference may well be to 2 Chronicles xxxiii. 6, where
Manasseh’s evil doings are enumerated. But it is not
without significance that we have in this passage the one
serious variation in the Greek text of the Prayer; for the
uncial T reads here in place of, “I have set up abominations,
and have multiplied detestable things,” these words:
“I have not done Thy will, nor kept Thy commandments.”<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
The variety of reading just at this particular spot suggests
the possibility of the text here having been uncertain, and
of having perhaps been altered for a particular purpose.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>We are inclined to believe that this Prayer was not originally
composed in reference to Manasseh, and that the title,
together with the words, “I have set up abominations,
and have multiplied detestable things,” was added later,
and thus made to refer to Manasseh, this having been done
under the influence of the numerous legends concerning this
king which seem to have been current.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVI_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Prayer</span></h4>

<p>The only indications of date are those to be derived
from the teaching contained in the book, and here everything
points to post-Maccabæan times. Thus, in verse 8 it is
said: “Thou, therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the
righteous, hast not appointed repentance unto the righteous,
unto Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned
against Thee”; this doctrine of the sinlessness of the
patriarchs does not, as far as we know, belong to pre-Maccabæan
times. In verse 4 are these words: “Who
hast shut up the Deep, and sealed it with Thy terrible and
glorious Name, Whom all things do dread”; the supernatural
efficacy which is here imputed to the Name of God
is likewise a late conception. Further, the whole burden
of the Prayer, namely, the need of repentance, is a specifically
Pharisaic <em>trait</em>, pointing to post-Maccabæan times. And
lastly, the conception of the underworld is a development
of the older belief, verse 13 runs: “Nor pass Thou sentence
against me when I am in the lowest parts of the earth;
for Thou, O Lord, art the God of them that repent.” Although
there is no hint of the resurrection here, the very
fact that God is conceived of as in any way concerned
with the souls of the departed is in itself an advance upon
the normal teaching of the Old Testament, and points to a
comparatively late date. It is, of course, impossible to
assign an exact date to the composition; Ryssel believes
that, like a number of other apocryphal works, it was composed
during the Maccabæan struggle, with the purpose of
urging upon the Jews the efficacy of true repentance as a
means of delivering them out of their troubles. This is
possible; but the teaching points, as we have said, to a post-Maccabæan
time. On the other hand, there is no reason
for regarding it as post-Christian; the fact that it is never
quoted or referred to until it appears <i lang="la">verbatim</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
<cite>Didascalia</cite><a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> (first half of the third century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) does not
necessarily imply a very late date; its shortness and the
character of its contents sufficiently account for its not being
mentioned earlier. Some time between <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 100-50 seems as
likely a date as any.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVI_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Writer and the Language in which he Wrote</span></h4>

<p>There can be no sort of doubt that the writer of this
Prayer was a Pharisee, and, moreover, one of the best type;
the spirit of true religion breathes through it, and it can
only have been written by one who was truly religious.
The Judaism which the Prayer reflects is of the Palestinian
type, and being a prayer one would expect it to have been
originally written in Hebrew, the “holy tongue.” The Greek
form in which we now possess this composition does not,
it is true, read like a translation excepting here and there
(e.g. verse 7, where Charles thinks a “real piece of evidence
on behalf of a Semitic original” is to be found), but, as
Ball points out, “the writer may have taken pains to
soften down the harshness of a baldly literal translation.”
Where linguistic indications do not give definite clues, we
must be guided by other considerations; the writer being
a Jew of the orthodox Palestinian type it is hard to believe
that he would have composed a prayer in any language
than that in which he had always been accustomed to pray;
and set forms of prayer, like the one before us, would have
been written in Hebrew, not in Aramaic.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHVII_I">I. <span class="smcap">Title and Authorship of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">What the title of this book in its original Hebrew form
(see below) was is not known for certain. Origen
gives a transliteration of the title (Eusebius, <cite>Hist. Eccles.</cite>, vi.
25, 2) which is equivalent to “The book of the house of the
Hasmonæans”; but he transliterates here an Aramaic
title which probably stood at the head of an Aramaic
translation of the Hebrew; possibly this title represented
the Hebrew form. On the other hand, the writer of the
book has clearly taken as his pattern the Books of the Kings,
so that the supposition is reasonable that he framed his
title in accordance with the form of the title of these; in
this case the title given in the Septuagint (which is followed
in the English Apocrypha) would probably represent the
original. The name “Maccabee” was applied in the first
instance to Judas (see 1 Macc. ii. 4, 6, etc.), but later to all
the members of the family and their followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span></p>

<p>As to the author, or more strictly compiler, of the book,
it is clear that he was an ardent patriot, and a rigid adherent
of orthodox Judaism; his intimate knowledge of the
geography and topography of the Holy Land marks him
out as a native of Palestine. His religious standpoint is
of particular interest, for he writes at a time (see <a href="#PII_CHVII_II">§ II</a> below)
when the distinct development of the Sadducees and Pharisees
as opposing parties had already taken place; yet, while
he is an upholder of Jewish orthodoxy and imbued with
an intensely patriotic spirit, he seems, nevertheless, to have
belonged to the circle of the Sadducees; “although a
loyal upholder of the Law, his zeal is not characterized by
any approach to Pharisaic fanaticism; his sympathy for
the Jewish high-priesthood is frequently manifested;
his tolerant attitude towards the profaning of the Sabbath
(see ii. 41, ix. 43 ff.) is very different from that which
would have been adopted by a Pharisee; there is not the
slightest hint of a belief in the life after death, (see ii. 52 ff.,
where a reference to this would have been eminently appropriate
had it been believed in). These reasons go far in
justifying the opinion that the author was a Sadducee.”<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
Further, it is noticeable that the writer has a strong belief
in what may be expressed by the modern proverb, that
“God helps those who help themselves”; but his insistence
on man’s free-will being the decisive factor in human affairs
is balanced by his firm belief in the existence of an all-seeing
Providence (see, e.g., iii. 18 ff., iv. 10 ff., ix. 46, xii.
15); yet it is strange that God is not once mentioned by
name in the whole book. This attitude was doubtless, in
part, owing to the influence of certain religious tendencies,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-412" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'centreing around'">
centering around</ins> the doctrine of God, which were beginning
to manifest themselves. “Just as there was a disinclination,
on account of its transcendent holiness, to utter the
name of God, and instead, to substitute paraphrases for it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
so there arose also a disinclination to ascribe action among
men directly to God, because of His inexpressible majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
It would seem, therefore, that the author represented a
type of Jew who was ready to assimilate much of what
appealed to him in Pharisaism while holding to the traditional
orthodoxy of the Sadducees.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVII_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Book</span></h4>

<p>The First Book of Maccabees must have been written
between the dates 135 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 63 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The events recorded
in the book took place between the years 175 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 135
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, so that this latter date is the earliest possible at which
it can have been written. On the other hand, Pompey
took Jerusalem in the autumn of 63 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and by entering
into the Holy of Holies desecrated the Temple<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>; had this
happened before our book was written it is inconceivable
that no mention should have been made of it; but as no
reference is made to it there can be no doubt that it took
place after the book was written. We can, however, get
nearer than this; it is said in xiii. 30, in reference to the
sepulchre which Simon the Maccabee built for his parents
and his four brothers at Modin: “This is the sepulchre
which he made at Modin, and it is there unto this day.”
It is said in xiii. 25 that this sepulchre was built on the
death of Jonathan, i.e. in 143 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the words “unto
this day” imply that it had been in existence for some
considerable time when the author wrote his book. There
are no means of ascertaining how long a time elapsed between
the building of the sepulchre and the writing of the book,
but if we assume that it was about half a century, this
would give as the date of the book some time between 100
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 90 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and this is a date to which a further fact
points; for in xvi. 23, 24 it is said: “And the rest of the acts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
of John, and of his wars, and his valiant deeds which he did,
and of the building of the walls which he built, and of his
doings, behold they are written in the chronicles of his high-priesthood,
from the time that he was made high-priest
after his father.”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Presumably the chronicles here referred
to took up the narrative at the point at which the writer of
our book ceased, for the Old Testament formula (and it
will have been noticed that the phraseology of this passage
is based on that of the Old Testament): “And the rest
of the acts” etc., is always employed in reference to a
ruler whose reign has already come to an end; so that the
writer of our book was writing subsequently to the time at
which the chronicles of John’s high-priesthood had been
compiled. The high-priest John, i.e. John Hyrcanus,
died in 105 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and therefore the writer of our book must
have begun his work some time after this date, though it is
not likely to have been long after this. Our conclusion is
that the book in its finished form appeared between 100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
and 90 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> But it is probable that the gathering of his
materials was begun by the author some considerable time
before this; for there are some graphic passages in the book
which give the impression that he was an eye-witness of
what he describes (see, e.g., xiv. 4-15, in which the details of
Simon’s reign are described). It seems not improbable
that the writer began to gather materials for his history as
early as the reign of Simon. The careful way in which his
book is written, and the numerous official documents from
which he made extracts, shows that the author must have
taken a long time over his work.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Original Language and Literary Character
of the Book</span></h4>

<p>That this book was originally written in Hebrew scarcely
admits of doubt; we have already pointed out that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
writer framed his work on the pattern of the Books of the
Kings, a fact which in itself suggests that he wrote in
Hebrew. But apart from this there are numberless indications
in our present Greek text which stamp it indubitably
as a translation from Hebrew; to give examples of this
would involve technical details which would be out of
place here<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>; it must suffice to say that the Greek again
and again has sentences which are literal translations of
Hebrew idiomatic phrases. But in spite of this the writer
has a distinct individuality of style; the narrative is
written in a simple, straightforward manner; it is full of
interest, the frequent graphic accounts of events impelling
attention throughout. The author writes as a historian,
whose duty it is to record the facts without bias; he is
impartial, and frankly recognizes and registers the defeat
of his own side when necessary. That he sometimes bursts
out into poetical strains, and not infrequently exaggerates,
especially where numbers are concerned, does not affect
the substantial truth and trustworthiness of his narrative.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Sources of the Book</span><a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></h4>

<p>The possibility of the author of our book having himself
been an eye-witness of some of the events he records has
already been hinted at; but whether this was so or not,
there can be little doubt that he utilized the accounts of
some, be they one or more, who had themselves seen what
they recounted. What impels one to this conviction are
the wonderfully graphic descriptions of some of the episodes
recorded; examples of this can be seen in iv. 1-24, vi.
28-54, vii. 26-50, ix. 1-22, 32-53, x. 59-66. The accounts
of eye-witnesses may, therefore, be reckoned as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
sources of the book. That he also had written sources to
draw from may be assumed from such passages as ix. 22:
“And the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars, and the
valiant deeds which he did, and his greatness, they are
not written,” the implication being that some other things
relating to him were written (cp. xi. 37, xiv. 18, 27, 48, 49);
and xvi. 23, 24, already quoted: “And the rest of the acts
of John ... behold, they are written in the chronicles
of his high-priesthood....”</p>

<p>In addition to these sources, there are a certain number
of documents which have been incorporated into the book.
These are for the most part important, and will require a
little detailed consideration. There are, in the first place,
some letters of <em>Jewish origin</em>, as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A letter from the Jews in Gilead asking Judas to
send them help because they were being attacked by the
Gentiles (v. 10-13). Although this purports to contain
the very words which were written, it is more probably
merely a summary of what the author of the book had
derived from some well-informed source. That it represents,
however, the contents of some written document,
and was not simply a verbal message, is evident; for it
stands in contrast to what is stated to have been a verbal
message in v. 15.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A letter from Jonathan to the Spartans (xii. 6-18).
The somewhat artificial way in which this letter has been
pressed into the text is sufficient to arouse suspicion. In
xii. 1 we are told of an embassy being sent to <em>Rome</em>; the
narrative is broken by verse 2, which refers to a letter that
had been sent to the <em>Spartans</em> and “to other places”; in
verse 3, which comes naturally after verse 1, the thread of
the narrative is taken up again. Then in verse 5, where one
might reasonably have expected further details concerning
the embassy to Rome, it goes on to say: “And this is
the copy of the letter which Jonathan wrote to the <em>Spartans</em>.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
The copy of this letter then follows; but the main
subject with which the chapter began (viz., the embassy to
Rome), obviously a more important one, is left without
further mention. The simplicity and straightforward flow
of the narrative, so characteristic of the book, is lacking
here, and the impression of something being out of order
is forced upon one. Then as to the letter itself, it is not
quite easy to understand what the purpose of it was. In
verse 10 the object is said to be the renewing of brotherhood
and friendship with the Spartans; but in the same breath,
as it were, it is said that the Jews needed none of these
things, “having for our encouragement the holy books
which are in our hands.” Then again, in verse 13, after
reference has been made to the afflictions which the Jews
had endured, the letter continues (in verses 14, 15): “We
were not mindful, therefore, to be troublesome unto you,
and to the rest of our confederates and friends, in these
wars; for we have the help which is from heaven to help
us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and our
enemies have been brought low.” The letter concludes
with the words (verses 17, 18); “We commanded them
(i.e. the ambassadors), therefore, to go also unto you, and
to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning the
renewing (of friendship) and our brotherhood. And now
ye shall do well if ye give us an answer thereto.” Thus, in
one and the same letter, while, on the one hand, friendship
and brotherhood are asked for, on the other, it is said that
these are not required; and yet, in the concluding words
of the letter some anxiety is evinced that a reply should be
forthcoming. That a relationship of some kind had existed
between the Jews and the Spartans is possible enough.
But the ambiguous character of this letter inclines one to
doubt its genuineness. Probably it was inserted by a
later editor who desired to emphasize the fact that a
relationship had existed between his people and the Spartans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
while not wishing to make it appear that his people had
any need to depend upon foreign help in their struggle
against their enemies.</p>

<p>In connection with this letter the following one must be
considered.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A letter from Areios, king of the Spartans, to Onias
the high-priest (xii. 20-23). This owes its presence here to
the fact that in the letter just dealt with Jonathan cites the
existence of former friendship between the Jews and the
Spartans as a reason for renewing the same (xii. 7-9); it is
added as an appendix to Jonathan’s letter. The original
of this document must have been written at least a century
and a half earlier; the fact of its being quoted here shows
with what care such documents were preserved.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In xiv. 27-47 we have a source of an entirely different
character. This passage contains a panegyric on Simon,
together with a <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of his prosperous reign. It is
stated to have been engraved on tables of brass, and to have
been set up in a conspicuous place within the precincts of the
sanctuary; copies of it are also said to have been deposited
in the treasury (verses 27, 48, 49). On comparing the details
of Simon’s reign given in this section with those in chapters
xi.-xiii., however, it will be found that there are several
chronological discrepancies. The course of the history, as
given in the book itself, is acknowledged on all hands to be,
on the whole, of a thoroughly trustworthy character; but if
the passage in question be really the copy of an original
document, which seems very probable, the accuracy of
chapters xi.-xiii. is, to some extent, impugned. It is difficult
to suppose that one and the same author would write the
historical account of Simon’s reign in these chapters, and then
in the very next chapter go on to give a <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of what had
preceded differing from it in a number of particulars. The
suggested explanation of the difficulty is as follows: The
original writer of the book gave in chapters xi.-xiii. a substantially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
correct account of the period of history in question,
but was inaccurate in the sequence of events; a later editor
added a copy of the document under consideration, to which
the original author of the book, for some reason or other, did
not have access. The later editor was not concerned with
the discrepancies between the written history and the copy
of the document which he added, because he saw that, in the
main, they were in agreement. Thus the two accounts of
Simon’s reign, differing to some extent, were left side by side.</p>

<p>A second class of documentary sources comprises letters
from <em>Syrian kings</em> to the Jewish leaders.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The first is a letter from Alexander Balas (he was not
yet king at the time) to Jonathan (x. 18-20). This is not a
copy of the letter itself, but merely its purport, which the
author of our book has woven into the narrative. It is far
too short and abrupt to be the actual letter of one who was
seeking the help and alliance of the Jewish leader, and for
whose friendship this aspirant to the Syrian throne was
bidding. The author of the book, moreover, adds some
words of his own in the middle of the letter (verse 20), a
thing which he would scarcely have done had he been
quoting the actual words of the letter itself. On the other
hand, there is not the slightest reason to doubt that use has
here been made of a genuine document.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A letter from Demetrius I to the Jewish nation (x. 25-45).
This was written for the purpose of out-bidding Alexander
Balas in promises of favour and privileges. It is probably
based on some original document; but the accuracy
of the details is open to question. The promises and concessions
are over-stated, and correspond so exactly, in many
respects, with the highest aspirations of the Jews at this
time that they suggest rather the expression of Jewish ideals
than actual promises.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A letter from Demetrius II to Jonathan, enclosing one
to Lasthenes (xi. 30-37). What has just been said applies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
here too. It represents an original letter, the contents of
which were utilized by our author, and elaborated by him in
accordance with his ideals.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A letter from Antiochus VI to Jonathan (xi. 57). This
is clearly a succinct summing-up of the contents of the
original letter; its extreme shortness and the absence of
salutation show that, although written in the first person,
it does not profess to give more than the general sense of the
original.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A letter from Demetrius II to Simon (xiii. 36-40).
This letter, in which the Syrian king acknowledges receipt
of certain presents from the Jewish high-priest, and confirms
earlier privileges, is stamped with the mark of genuineness;
it reads like an original, and is doubtless a copy of one.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) A letter from Antiochus VII to Simon (xv. 2-9). To
some extent what has been said in regard to (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) applies
also to this letter. It is probably not a <i lang="la">verbatim</i> copy of
the original, but represents, at all events in parts, the contents
of the original. On the other hand, there are elements
in it which are the expression of ardent desires rather than
of actual facts.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a third class of documentary sources which
record the relations between the Jews and the <em>rulers of
foreign kingdoms</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A treaty of alliance between the Romans and the
Jews (viii. 23-32). In verses 24 ff. it is stated, as one of the
articles of the treaty, that if the Romans are attacked by an
enemy the Jews may not render that enemy any help,
whether of “food, arms, money, or ships” (verse 26). This
mention of ships is held by some to show that this
document belonged to a date later than the time of Judas,
in whose time the Jews possessed no ships, and that therefore
the whole section is a later interpolation. But it is
quite possible that the foresight of the Romans sufficiently
explains this mention of ships; or they might have assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
the possession of ships by a nation whose country had a long
coast-line. It was not long after the death of Judas that the
Jews did acquire a harbour (see xiii. 29, xiv. 5). There
seems no sufficient reason to doubt that a genuine document
has here been utilized.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A letter from the Spartans to Simon (xiv. 20-22).
We are confronted here with a difficulty similar to that
which occurs in the letter from Jonathan to the Spartans
in xii. 6-18 (see above). The section opens (verse 16) with
the words: “And it was heard at Rome that Jonathan was
dead, and even unto Sparta, and they were exceedingly
sorry.” It then goes on to say that the Romans wrote
to Simon, who had succeeded his brother Jonathan, on
tables of brass to renew “the friendship and the confederacy”
(verse 18); but then, instead of giving a copy of this document,
as might reasonably be expected, it goes on to say:
“And this is a copy of the letter which the Spartans sent.”
In this letter it is stated that the two Jewish ambassadors
who were the bearers of it were Numenius, the son of
Antiochus, and Antipater, the son of Jason. But then the
narrative (verse 24) goes on: “After this Simon sent Numenius
to Rome with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound
weight, in order to confirm the confederacy with them.”
On the previous occasion on which mention is made of a
confederacy between the Jews and the Romans, on the one
hand, and the Spartans on the other, the same two ambassadors
were sent, first to the Romans and then to the Spartans,
on the same journey (see xii. 16, 17); on the present occasion
it is to be presumed, for the text implies it, that this was
again done; but if so, how is one to account for the fact that
in the letter to the Spartans these ambassadors are said to be
the bearers of it, while, immediately after (verse 24), it is
said that Numenius started on his journey? There is also a
further difficulty; is it likely, as stated in the text, that on
the death of Jonathan the Romans would have taken the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
initiative in renewing the treaty with the Jews? This
seems to be directly contradicted by what is said in verse 24
(quoted above). It would appear that verses 17-23 are an
interpolation added later; this would also explain the otherwise
unaccountable words, “and even unto Sparta,” in
verse 16, which were presumably put in because of the
interpolation. The contents of this letter read like an official
document, the probability is that use was made of some
genuine record which was interpolated at a later period.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A letter from Lucius, the Roman consul, to Ptolemy
Euergetes II, king of Egypt (xv. 16-21). This is the copy
of a circular letter written in the name of “Lucius the
consul,” and brought back from Rome by Numenius. In it
the friendship between the Romans and the Jews is proclaimed;
copies of it are sent not only to the kings of Egypt
and Syria, but also to a number of small independent States.
Now Josephus (<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XIV, viii. 5) mentions a letter from
the Roman Senate, written in the name of the praetor Lucius
Valerius in reply to a message brought by a Jewish embassy.
As in the case just referred to, Numenius, the son of Antiochus,
is one of the ambassadors (two others accompany him),
and he brings a gift of a golden shield; the contents of this
letter are similar to those of the letter in our book, and it is
likewise sent to a number of petty independent States. But,
according to Josephus, this happened in the ninth year of
Hyrcanus II, who reigned <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63-40. Now if, as is maintained
by some, especially by Willrich,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Josephus is right here, the
passage we are dealing with must be an interpolation.
Mommsen<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> has, indeed, proved that Josephus is recording
genuine history in saying that the praetor Lucius Valerius
sent a letter to the Jews, with the contents as given, during
the reign of Hyrcanus II. This does not, however,
constitute an insuperable difficulty, for one of the consuls in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 139 was named Lucius Calpurnius Piso, and the “Consul
Lucius,” spoken of in the text (xv. 16) could quite well refer
to him. What is more difficult is the fact of the great
similarity in the contents between the letter given in our
book and of that given by Josephus; Mommsen maintains
that they are not identical, which would mitigate the
difficulty; but the mention of Numenius, the son of Antiochus,
in both letters is a grave difficulty. Probably Willrich is
right in regarding the passage as a later interpolation, added
because it seemed to be appropriate in a place where Simon’s
treaty with Rome was mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>These, then, are the sources from which our book was
compiled; they show that the writer of 1 Maccabees had
access to a number of official documents in addition to the
accounts of events which he received from eye-witnesses. The
documentary sources shed a most valuable light on the
external policy of the Jews as well as on the important <i lang="fr">rôle</i>
they played in shaping Syrian politics; so that for the
history of the Jews of this period our book may well be
described as the most valuable source which we possess.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVII_V">V. <span class="smcap">The History of the Maccabæan Struggle</span></h4>

<p>The momentous struggle for religious liberty and political
independence which is described in our book deals with the
period 175-135 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, i.e. from the accession of Antiochus
Epiphanes to the death of Simon Maccabæus. The divisions
of the book are clearly marked, recording respectively
the progress of the war under the leadership of Mattathias,
Judas, Jonathan, and Simon; and each division has as its
central subject the description of an event of supreme
importance to the Jews, thus: the first division records
the opening of the struggle and its cause; the second tells
of how religious liberty was acquired; the third describes
the establishment of the Hasmonæan high-priesthood; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
the last shows how the way to political independence was
secured.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The contents of these, together with the short
Introduction by which they are prefaced, must now occupy
our attention.</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHVII_a">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Conquests of Alexander the Great, and the Division
of his Empire</i> (i. 1-9)</h5>

<p>In pregnant words Alexander’s conquests are thus summed
up: “And he waged many wars, and won strongholds, and
slew kings, and pressed forward to the ends of the earth,
and took spoils from many peoples.” In describing what
happened on Alexander’s death-bed the writer says that the
kingdom was divided among the dying king’s chief ministers
“while he was yet alive,” and that after he was dead “they
all assumed the diadem.” This does not agree with the
statement made by Justin Martyr, Diodorus Siculus, and
Curtius, to the effect that when the dying king was no longer
able to speak he handed his signet-ring to the captain of
his bodyguard, Perdiccas, whom he thus indicated as his
successor. That all the chief ministers assumed the diadem
after the king was dead is an inaccurate statement, as only
five of Alexander’s generals assumed the title of king, and
that not until <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 306, seventeen years after his death.
Here, as in a number of other cases, the writer of our book
shows that his knowledge concerning the affairs of foreign
nations is imperfect; but the value of the book as a whole,
and the credibility of the narrative in general, is not affected
by these inaccuracies; “we see in this only the simple standpoint
of the observer who, following his sources, confines his
view exclusively to the circle of Jewish affairs” (Schürer).</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHVII_b">(<i>b</i>) <i>The Original Cause of the Struggle; the Leadership
of Mattathias</i> (i. 10-ii. 70)</h5>

<p>As we are clearly shown in this division the original cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
of the Maccabæan struggle was of a twofold character;
internal and external forces brought it about. A not inconsiderable
section of the Jewish people had been captivated
by the attractions of Hellenism, and were ready to give up
their own faith and practice in exchange for that of the
Gentiles; “they joined themselves to the Gentiles, and
sold themselves to do evil” (i. 15). When Antiochus Epiphanes
had overcome Ptolemy, king of Egypt, he proceeded
to deal with the Jews; “he went up against Israel and
Jerusalem with a great army; and in his arrogance he
entered into the sanctuary” (i. 20, 21); having taken
everything in the Temple on which he could lay hands, he
returned home. For two years the people were left in peace;
then another blow was inflicted on them. Apollonius,
a “chief collector of tribute,” was sent by Antiochus to
Jerusalem with an army; he pretended that his mission was
a peaceful one, and with smooth words imposed upon the
people; then suddenly he fell upon the city, and a general
sack seems to have taken place. The citadel was occupied
by the foreign troops, and the people were reduced to sore
straits. All this, however, did not rouse the people to
resistance. Then came the edict of uniformity of worship,
put forth by Antiochus; to realize how this was intended to
affect the Jews it will be well to quote some words from it;
the Jews were commanded that “they should practise
customs foreign to the traditions of the land, and that they
should cease the sacrificing of the whole burnt-offerings, and
sacrifices, and drink-offerings in the sanctuary; and that they
should profane the sabbaths and feasts, and pollute the
sanctuary and those who had been sanctified; that they
should, moreover, build high places, and sacred groves, and
shrines for idols, and that they should sacrifice swine and
other unclean animals; and that they should leave their
sons uncircumcized, and make themselves abominable by
means of practising everything that was unclean and profane,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
so that they might forget the Law, and change all the
traditional ordinances” (i. 44-49). It was this which was the
immediate cause of the Maccabæan revolt. But it may be
questioned whether Antiochus would have attempted such a
cruel coercion had it not been for the presence of that strong
Hellenistic party among the Jews to which reference has
already been made. No sooner was the edict promulgated
than this Hellenistic party began to carry out its commands;
“many in Israel took delight in the king’s form of worship,
and they began sacrificing to idols, and profaned the sabbath”
(i. 43). The king’s officers went from city to city to enforce
the edict; a rigorous search was also made for all copies of
the Law, which were burned; horrible cruelties were perpetrated
on all who remained faithful to the ancestral
religion. Intense indignation took hold of the faithful in
Israel; numbers resisted, and suffered death rather than
deny their God; but resistance of individuals was of no
avail; what was required was a leader around whom the
people could gather, and who would direct corporate action.
Such a leader soon appeared.</p>

<p>In going from city to city to enforce the decrees of the
king’s edict, the royal officers came to Modin, the present
El-Medije, east of Lydda; this was the native city of the
family of the Maccabees, of whom Mattathias was the head.
The officers called on him to set an example of obedience to
the royal commands, but he indignantly refused; thereupon
an apostate Jew stepped forth with the object of sacrificing
according to heathen rites on the altar at Modin; this
aroused the righteous wrath of Mattathias to the highest
pitch, he rushed upon his faithless fellow-townsman and
killed him as he stood by the altar; then, turning upon one
of the king’s officers, he slew him too. “Let every one that
is zealous for the Law,” he then cried out to his people, “and
that would maintain the covenant, come after me!” The
standard of revolt was now definitely raised; large numbers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
of the Jews followed Mattathias into the mountains, among
them many of the <em>Chassidim</em>. It was not sufficient for
these patriots merely to act on the defensive, but, as the
writer of our book says, they “smote sinners in their anger,
and lawless men in their wrath.... Mattathias and his
friends went round about, and pulled down altars, and they
circumcized by force the children that were uncircumcized
... and they pursued after the sons of pride, and the work
prospered in their hand” (ii. 44-47).</p>

<p>In the following year (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 167-166) Mattathias died;
but his bold step had done its work in consolidating a
vigorous and determined body of patriots. He directed that
his third son, Judas, should take his place as leader in war,
while Simon, the elder brother of Judas, should act as chief
counsellor.</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHVII_c">(<i>c</i>) <i>The Leadership of Judas Maccabæus; Religious Liberty
Secured</i> (iii. 1-ix. 22)</h5>

<p>Judas’ capacity as a military leader was very soon vindicated
by two signal victories gained over Apollonius,
already mentioned, and Seron, the Syrian commander.
Judas had taken the initiative in attacking the armies under
these two generals in each case; his quickness in appreciating
the position of affairs, and his promptitude in action were the
cause of these victories, which seem to have had a profound
moral effect both on his own people and on others. Even
allowing for some very natural exaggeration the following
words doubtless reflect the actual facts: “Then began the
fear of Judas and of his brethren, and the dread of them fell
upon the nations round about them. And his name came
near even unto the king; and every nation told of the battles
of Judas” (iii. 25, 26).</p>

<p>Antiochus was, of course, greatly incensed when he heard
of the defeats of his forces; but being in want of money he
found it necessary to go to Persia in order to raise funds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
charging Lysias, “one of the seed royal,” to undertake to
punish the rebels. The first act of Lysias was to raise a
force of forty thousand footmen and seven thousand horse,
which he despatched under three of his generals, Ptolemy,
Nicanor, and Gorgias, to Judæa to subdue Judas. An
attempted night surprise by Gorgias with part of the Syrian
army failed through the vigilance of Judas; and the following
day Judas again took the initiative with great success,
the Syrians fleeing in disorder, and losing about three thousand
men. The next year Lysias raised a still larger army
which he commanded in person; but again the fortune of
war went against him, and he suffered a serious defeat.</p>

<p>The Jews were now able to enjoy a short respite, which was
utilized for the purpose of rebuilding and re-dedicating the
Temple. It was on this occasion that the feast of <em>Chanukkah</em>
(“Dedication”) was instituted; it has been regularly
observed by orthodox Jews ever since.</p>

<p>But peace did not last long; the Jews were now attacked
by some of the smaller peoples who had made common cause
with the chief enemy. However, Judas had little difficulty in
silencing these, viz., the Edomites, Bæanites, and Ammonites.
Scarcely was this accomplished, when Judas received news
that many of his people in Gilead were in straits owing
to the hostility of the Gentiles; in Galilee also the same
thing was happening. He thereupon sent his brother Simon
with an adequate force into Galilee, while he himself went
over the Jordan. In both theatres of the war success
continued to attend the Jewish arms.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 163 Antiochus Epiphanes died while yet in
Persia; he was succeeded by his son, Antiochus Eupator,
who had been nourished up while yet young by Lysias.
But the death of Epiphanes brought no rest to the Jews.
Judas had, in the meantime, returned to Jerusalem; and
he determined now to expel the garrison which had been
stationed in the citadel from the beginning of the struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
He, therefore, besieged the citadel, and further strengthened
his own position by fortifying Bethsura; this place occupied
an important strategical position on the road between
Jerusalem and Hebron; Josephus (<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XIII, v. 6) speaks
of it as “the strongest place in all Judæa.” Those who were
besieged in the citadel managed to send word to the king,
who came, accompanied by Lysias, with a large army to
check the designs of Judas. In this he succeeded for the
time; Bethsura was starved out, and Jerusalem was taken by
means of an act of the basest treachery. This happened in
the following manner: when Antiochus Epiphanes was on
his death-bed he designated Philip, one of his nearest friends,
as regent during the minority of the new king (vi. 14, 15);
but the latter had been under the special care of Lysias
hitherto; and as Philip was in Persia, while Lysias, with the
new king, was in Syria at headquarters, Lysias took the
place of adviser and guide to the king. Now while the king
was busy fighting against Judas, as just recounted, Philip,
determined to assert himself, returned from Persia and
“sought to take unto him the government” (vi. 56); he had
with him the army which Epiphanes had led into Persia;
the position was clearly serious for the king and Lysias; so
on the advice of the latter peace was made with Judas, and
all that he had been fighting for, i.e. religious liberty, was
accorded. Judas, trusting to the good faith of the king and
Lysias, came forth, and “the king entered into Mount
Sion”; but having thus got possession of the stronghold
the king repudiated his oath, and had the place dismantled,
though the Jews still retained their hold upon it. Then he
went to deal with Philip, whom he found in possession of
Antioch, the capital; he fought against Philip, defeated
him, and took the city. His triumph was, however, short-lived;
for in the following year he was assassinated by
command of Demetrius, who now became king. A short
digression is necessary here in order to explain the position of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
Demetrius. When Antiochus III (the Great) died he left
two sons, Seleucus IV (Philopator), the elder, who became
king, and Antiochus (afterwards Epiphanes), who lived at
Rome as a hostage. In order that his brother might be released,
Seleucus IV sent his own son, Demetrius, as a hostage
to Rome. When Antiochus reached Syria he found that his
brother had been murdered, and instead of requiting the
kindness that had been shown him by endeavouring to help
Demetrius, the lawful heir, to the throne, he usurped the
kingdom himself, while Demetrius was left in Rome. When
Antiochus Epiphanes died his son, as we have seen, came to
the throne, though Demetrius was, of course, still the rightful
heir. But Demetrius succeeded in making his escape from
Rome, and was thus enabled to come to his own. This was
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 162; he was the first king of this name to reign over
Syria, and received the name of Soter<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>; he reigned till
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 150.</p>

<p>No sooner was Demetrius seated on the throne than the
war against the Jews recommenced. Bacchides, one of the
“king’s friends,” and the “ungodly Alcimus,” whom
Demetrius had made high-priest, were sent against Judas;
but Bacchides soon returned to the king, leaving Alcimus
with an army to look after the land. He, however, also
returned to the king when he saw that Judas was too strong
for him. The king, therefore, sent a new army against the
Jews under the command of Nicanor. Once more Judas
was victorious, Nicanor fell in the battle and his army was
scattered. Then, it is said, “the land of Judah had rest a
little while” (vii. 50). If we are to trust the contents of
chapter viii. of our book, Judas at this point made an alliance
with the Romans (see above, <a href="#Page_420">p. 420</a>), in consequence of which
they wrote to Demetrius, saying, “Wherefore hast thou
made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
Jews? If, therefore, they plead any more against thee, we
will do them justice, and fight thee by sea and land” (viii. 32).
This threat did not, however, have any effect, for on Demetrius
hearing of the death of Nicanor and the defeat of his
forces, he despatched Bacchides and Alcimus a second time
against Judas; this time they were too strong for the Jews,
who were defeated, and, worst of all, Judas fell. But
Jerusalem continued in the possession of the Jews, and the
Temple services were celebrated; so that religious liberty
had been gained and retained by the devoted courage and
perseverance of Judas.</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHVII_d">(<i>d</i>) <i>The Leadership of Jonathan; the Establishment of the
Hasmonæan High-priesthood</i> (ix. 23-xii. 53)</h5>

<p>The first result of the death of Judas was, not unnaturally,
to fill the patriots with despair. But this did not last long;
and the people came to his brother Jonathan and elected him
as their leader.</p>

<p>As soon as Bacchides got to know of this he renewed the
attack, but was repulsed by Jonathan. This seems to have
been a more crushing defeat, judging by the sequel, than the
short account of it (ix. 43-49) would imply; for the Jews
were left in peace for two years. At the end of that time
another futile attempt was made by Bacchides, and he was
glad to make terms of peace with Jonathan. What immense
progress had been made by the patriots can be
seen by these pregnant words: “And the sword ceased from
Israel. And Jonathan dwelt at Michmash. And Jonathan
began to judge the people; and he destroyed the ungodly
out of Israel” (ix. 73).</p>

<p>The Maccabæan struggle now enters upon a new phase
owing to the activity of the rival claimants to the Syrian
throne; the Maccabæan power, as it may now be called,
comes to occupy the position of the “deciding factor,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
is thus courted first by one and then by the other claiment
to the throne.</p>

<p>When it is said, as quoted above, that “the sword ceased
from Israel ...” the period of peace was, according to our
book, one of about seven years; during the whole of this
time the only act of war recorded is the abortive attempt by
Bacchides to subdue Jonathan, as told in ix. 58-73. So that
it looks as though Demetrius I had given up the struggle
against these formidable champions of liberty. But the
Jews had not yet gained all they intended to have; their
first objective, viz., religious liberty, was already attained,
mainly through the efforts of Judas; but they had now
learned to realize their own power, and had determined
to acquire political independence as well.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 153, when Demetrius had ruled for about ten
years, a rival to the Syrian throne appeared in the person of
one Alexander Balas. This man, a low-born native of
Smyrna, gave himself out to be the son of Antiochus Epiphanes;
the claim received some support owing to his
resemblance to the late usurper, Antiochus Eupator. The
cause of Alexander was taken up by Attalus II, king of
Pergamum, who supported his claims to the kingdom of
Syria against Demetrius. Although, according to Polybius
(xxxiii. 14, 6), it was well known that the claims of Alexander
were without justification, he was, nevertheless, supported
by the Roman Senate, who promised to help him. His
success, to which we shall refer presently, was largely due to
the fact that Demetrius was hated by his own people on
account of his “insolence and difficulty of access,” and
because he was “slothful and negligent about public affairs”;
so Josephus tells us (<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XIII, ii. 1). Alexander appeared
suddenly upon the scene; his first act was to take possession
of Ptolemais; in this he had no difficulty, for he was welcomed
as king by the inhabitants. As soon as Demetrius
heard of this he gathered his forces together; but before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
going to battle he sought to gain Jonathan for his cause;
“let us be beforehand to make peace with them,” he said,
“ere he make peace with Alexander against us” (x. 4).
The promises of Demetrius were, however, out-bidden by
those of Alexander, who wrote to Jonathan as soon as he
heard of Demetrius’ action. In his letter Alexander writes:
“We have appointed thee this day to be high-priest of
thy nation....” This was the first beginning of the establishment
of the Hasmonæan<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> high-priesthood, though it was
not fully consolidated until some years later (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 141).<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> It
was in vain that Demetrius wrote a second letter to Jonathan
full of the most extravagant promises<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> (x. 26-45), for
Jonathan and the people “gave no credence” to his words;
an alliance was, on the other hand, made with Alexander.
A battle was then fought between Alexander and Demetrius;
but the account of this, as given in x. 48 ff., is incomprehensible,
we have to turn to Josephus (<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XIII, ii. 4) to understand
what really happened: “And when it was come to a
battle, the left wing of Demetrius put those who opposed
them to flight, and pursued them a great way, and slew
many of them, and spoiled their camp. But the right wing,
where Demetrius happened to be, was beaten; and as for
all the rest, they ran away. But Demetrius fought courageously,
and slew a great many of the enemy; but as he was
in pursuit of the rest, his horse carried him into a deep bog,
where it was hard to get out, and there it happened, that
upon his horse’s falling down, he could not escape being
killed; for when his enemies saw what had befallen him, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
returned back, and encompassed Demetrius round, and
they all threw their darts at him; but he, being now on foot,
fought bravely; but at length he received so many wounds
that he was not able to bear up any longer, and fell.” The
battle seems, thus, to have been indecisive until Demetrius
fell, when evidently his followers lost heart. Alexander’s
next step was to make a treaty with Ptolemy VI, Philometor,
king of Egypt, whose daughter, Cleopatra, he married, the
marriage being celebrated with great pomp at Ptolemais; the
Egyptian king himself was present. Alexander, further,
invited Jonathan to Ptolemais, where he was received with
much honour, the friendship and alliance between the two
being thus consolidated.</p>

<p>For a few years Alexander was left in peaceful possession
of the Syrian throne, but in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 147 the son of Demetrius,
Demetrius Nicator, came from Crete, where he had been
living in exile since the war between his father and Alexander
began, and sought, as the rightful heir, to regain his kingdom.
He appointed Apollonius his commander-in-chief. An
army having been raised, Apollonius encamped in Jamnia
(Jabneh), and tried conclusions first with Jonathan, Alexander’s
ally. Jonathan was ably seconded by his brother
Simon, and between them they inflicted a severe defeat on
Apollonius. Alexander, on hearing this, “honoured Jonathan
yet more; and he sent unto him a buckle of gold, as
the use is to give to such as are of the kindred of the kings;
moreover, he gave him Ekron and all the borders thereof
for a possession” (x. 89).</p>

<p>This friendship between Alexander and Jonathan was
soon destined to place the latter in a very awkward position,
though he managed to extricate himself owing mainly to
his having so firmly established his power. This came
about in the following way. A treaty was made between
Ptolemy VI and Demetrius Nicator, in spite of the former’s
alliance with Alexander. Antioch was besieged by Ptolemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
and Alexander escaped to Arabia; but here he was treacherously
murdered, while Ptolemy himself died only a few
days afterwards. This left all clear for Demetrius, who now
became king. As Jonathan had supported the new king’s
rival, his position was now of a somewhat awkward character.
However, both the king and Jonathan considered it to
be of advantage to themselves if they were at peace, so
friendship was concluded between them.</p>

<p>But Demetrius II was not to be left in peace long. Alexander
had left a son, Antiochus, in Arabia, whose cause was
now about to be championed by Tryphon; the latter had been
one of the close friends of Alexander. The time was propitious
for Tryphon to attempt to gain the kingdom for his
late master’s son, for Demetrius had unwisely disbanded the
bulk of his troops when he saw that peace was established;
in consequence of this they had revolted. In his distress he
looked for help to Jonathan; nor did he look in vain; for
Jonathan sent him three thousand men to Antioch. With
the help of these Demetrius was enabled to re-establish himself.
Things might have continued to go well with him,
but he foolishly fell out with Jonathan, and had soon to pay
the penalty. For Tryphon now made a second attempt;
he brought the young Antiochus, still a child, with him, and
gathered around him all the troops which Demetrius had
disbanded. With these he stormed Antioch, and Demetrius
had to flee. The first act of Antiochus (the sixth as he now
was) again showed the position which Jonathan had gained;
guided, of course, by Tryphon, he sent word to Jonathan,
confirming him in the high-priesthood and in the governorship
of the governments of Judæa, Ephraim, Lydda, and
Ramathaim, and conferring other honours upon him; at
the same time setting Simon, Jonathan’s brother, over the
district from “the ladder of Tyre”<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> to the Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
frontier. The Jewish leaders were not slow to appreciate
this politic step on the part of Antiochus; they immediately
undertook a victorious campaign against their own enemies
as well as against those of the king. Jonathan himself
went to Galilee, whither Demetrius had fled, with the purpose
of punishing him; Demetrius seems to have succeeded
in gathering an army again, and a pitched battle took place.
At first it looked as though Jonathan were going to get the
worst of it; but ultimately he triumphed, and Demetrius again
fled, and, for the present, gave up the struggle in Syria in
order to try his fortune against the Parthians; but he was
taken prisoner by the Parthians, and remained in captivity for
ten years, after which, as we shall see, he again appeared in
Syria.</p>

<p>In the meantime Tryphon himself aspired to the Syrian
throne; he caused Antiochus VI to be killed, and usurped
the kingdom. But fearing Jonathan, Tryphon captured
him by treachery and imprisoned him.</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHVII_e">(<i>e</i>) <i>The Leadership of Simon</i> (xiii. 1-xvi. 24)</h5>

<p>Simon’s first act was to try to avenge his brother; he
did, indeed, severely defeat Tryphon and drive him out of
the country, but not until Tryphon had murdered Jonathan
with his own hand. It was Simon’s conviction that his
wisest course would now be to bring about the re-instatement
of Demetrius II; he accordingly sent messengers to
Demetrius with this intimation, and, of course, received a
very favourable reply (xiii. 36-40). The next thing that
we hear of Demetrius is that he went into Media to get
help to fight against Tryphon, who had by no means given up
his hopes of regaining the throne. Demetrius was captured,
however, by the king of Persia and Media, and again shut
up in prison.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span></p>

<p>With Demetrius II in prison, and Tryphon driven out of
the country, a new aspirant to the throne now appears in the
person of Antiochus VII (Sidetes), the brother of Demetrius.</p>

<p>The new king, as had now become customary, first
addresses himself to the Jewish leader; having gained his
good-will by making many promises, Antiochus enters into
the kingdom. Here he finds Tryphon, whom he besieges
in Dor; Tryphon managed to escape by ship, and is no
more mentioned in our book.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Shortly after this Antiochus,
believing, presumably, that his position was sufficiently
strong, and desiring to show that he could stand alone,
repudiated his treaty with Simon, and would not receive
him, “but set at nought everything that he had previously
covenanted with him; and he was estranged from him”
(xv. 27). Then he proceeded to send a force under Cendebæus
to attack Judæa, and to worry the Jewish people in
various ways. Simon, feeling the weight of age upon him,
appointed his two eldest sons, Judas and John, to undertake
the further prosecution of the war. They attack Cendebæus
and defeat him; Judas was wounded, but John returned
to Judæa in peace (xv. 9, 10).</p>

<p>Our book now gives an account of another act of treachery
which threatened to annihilate the direct line of the family
of the Maccabees. Ptolemy, “the son of Abubus, Simon’s
son-in-law, who had been appointed captain over the
plain of Jericho,” desired to secure for himself the supreme
power, for which purpose it was necessary that Simon and
his sons should be got out of the way. The writer of our
book recounts in pregnant phrases what happened: “Now
Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and
taking care for the good ordering of them. And he went down
to Jericho, he himself and Mattathias and Judas, his sons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
in the one hundred and seventy-seventh year [= <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 135],
in the eleventh month, the same is the month Sebat [= February].
And the son of Abubus received them deceitfully
into the little stronghold that is called Dôk, which he had
built, and he made them a great banquet; and he hid men
there. And when Simon and his sons had drunk freely,
Ptolemy and they that were with him rose up, and took their
arms, and came upon Simon into the banqueting hall, and
slew him and his two sons, and certain of his servants. And
he committed thus a great act of treachery, and recompensed
evil for good” (xvi. 14-17). John was not with his father
at the time, but Ptolemy despatched his creatures to Gazara,
where John was staying, to murder him. Fortunately,
however, John was warned in time, and “he laid hands on
the men that came to destroy him, and slew them”
(xvi. 22).</p>

<p>Our book closes with a reference to the acts of John which
are written in “the chronicles of his high-priesthood”
(xvi. 24).</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Title of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The book now to be considered has, with few exceptions,
been treated with scant respect by scholars
for many centuries. Jerome, in his Preface to the books
of Ezra and Nehemiah, condemned both the Esdras books
in our Apocrypha with their “dreams,” and the Church has
followed him in relegating them to a very inferior position.
It is only during the last decade or so that, owing, in the
main, to the labours of Sir Henry Howorth, scholars have
come to realize the importance of 1 (3) Esdras, with which
we are at present concerned.</p>

<p>The various titles of the Ezra books are apt, thanks
largely to Jerome, to cause confusion; it will therefore,
be advisable to set forth these different titles in tabular
form, which will also explain how they have arisen:</p>

<p>It will conduce to clearness if we speak of our present
book as the “Greek Ezra” and ignore these confusing titles.
By the “Hebrew Ezra” is meant, of course, the canonical
book of Ezra.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_II">II. <span class="smcap">Contents of the Book</span></h4>

<p>As will be seen by referring to the table given above, the
contents of our book correspond substantially with parts
of the canonical Scriptures<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>; but the “Greek Ezra” does
not run wholly parallel with the “Hebrew Ezra,” so that
in enumerating the contents of the former it will be necessary
to record against each section to what passage in the
canonical Scriptures it corresponds, whether to some passage
in the “Hebrew Ezra,” or in 2 Chronicles, or in Nehemiah.</p>

<p>i. 1-58 (= 2 Chron. xxxv., xxxvi. 1-21): The book begins
very abruptly with a long account of Josiah’s celebration
of the Passover in Jerusalem (verses 1-24). Then follows
the story of Josiah’s death at the battle of Megiddo where
he was defeated by the king of Egypt; reference is made to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
“the book of the histories of the kings of Judæa,” where
these things are written (verses 25-33). The rest of the
section deals with Josiah’s successors down to the destruction
of Jerusalem (verses 34-58).</p>

<p>ii. 1-15 (= 2 Chron. xxxvi. 22, 23 and Ezra i. 1-11):
Cyrus the Persian issues a decree permitting the return of
the people and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem;
the sacred vessels of the Temple are given back.</p>

<p>ii. 16-30 (= Ezra iv. 7-24): The Samaritans address a
letter to Artaxerxes accusing the Jews of the intention to rebel
in rebuilding the walls of the city, and warning him of what
the result will be if the building is persisted in (verses 16-24).
The purpose of the letter is successful, and the building
ceases until the second year of Darius (verses 25-30).</p>

<p>iii. 1-v. 3 (no corresponding passage in the canonical
Scriptures): The wisdom competition among three young
men of Darius’ bodyguard. Zerubbabel proves himself
to be wisest and is rewarded by the king (iii. 1-iv. 46); the
reward consists in granting Zerubbabel his request that the
king would issue a decree permitting the Jews to return to
their country and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and the
Temple (iv. 47-57). Zerubbabel’s thanksgiving (iv. 58-63),
and the return of the exiles (v. 1-3).</p>

<p>v. 4-6 (no corresponding passage in the canonical Scriptures):
These verses contain the fragment of a list of the
returned exiles.</p>

<p>v. 7-73 (= Ezra ii. 1-iv. 5, 24 and Neh. vii. 6-73): A
list of those who returned from Babylon under Zerubbabel,
Joshua and Nehemiah (verses 7-46); the rebuilding of the
Temple (verses 47-65); the Samaritans desire to assist in
the work, but are refused; in consequence of this they plot
against the Jews, and the building is suspended (verses 66-73).</p>

<p>vi. 1-vii. 15 (= Ezra v. 1-vi. 22): The building of the
Temple is begun (vi. 1-6); the letter of Sisinnes, the governor
of Syria and Phœnicia, to Darius, asking him to signify his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
approval of the undertaking (vi. 7-22); the favourable
reply of Darius (vi. 23-34). The completion of the building
of the Temple, and its dedication (vii. 1-9). Celebration
of the Feast of Passover (vii. 10-15).</p>

<p>viii. 1-ix. 36 (= Ezra vii. 1-x. 44): With the permission
of Artaxerxes, Ezra goes to Jerusalem with “certain of the
children of Israel and of the priests and Levites” (viii. 1-7).
Copy of the commission written by Artaxerxes to Ezra
(viii. 8-24). A list of those who returned with Ezra (viii.
25-60). The return to Jerusalem, and Ezra’s work in
combating mixed marriages (viii. 61-ix. 36).</p>

<p>ix. 37-55 (= Neh. vii. 73-viii. 12): The reading of the
Law of Moses by Ezra.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It will thus be seen that the whole of our book, with the
exception of iii. 1-v. 6, runs parallel with passages from the
“Hebrew Ezra” and parts of 2 Chronicles and Nehemiah.
But it will be well to consider the relationship between our
book and the “Hebrew Ezra,” and also to inquire as to the
relationship of 2 Esdras, or Esdras B, to our book.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_III">III. <span class="smcap">The “Hebrew Ezra,” the “Greek Ezra,” and
2 Esdras</span></h4>

<p>In the table given above it will be seen that the Hebrew
Book of Ezra is represented twice in the Septuagint, viz.
by 2 Esdras and the “Greek Ezra,” and that both the
Greek forms contain more than simply a translation of the
“Hebrew Ezra,” since 2 Esdras has the whole of what was
once a single Hebrew book (Ezra-Nehemiah), and our
“Greek Ezra” has some matter in addition to the translation
of Ezra.</p>

<p>Our first point is to see how the “Hebrew Ezra” and the
“Greek Ezra” compare. As regards the sequence of
events there are only two cases of any considerable divergence,
namely, ii. 16-30 (= Ezra iv. 7-24) is out of place,
and ix. 37-55 (= Neh. vii. 73-viii. 12) which follows viii.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
1-ix. 36 (= Ezra vii. 1-x. 44) varies from the order in the
Hebrew Bible. Otherwise the material of the two is the
same, with the one exception of iii. 1-v. 3, the story of the
wisdom competition between the three young men of
Darius’ bodyguard; this is peculiar to our “Greek Ezra,”<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
and, unlike the rest of the book, was originally composed in
Greek. The rest of the book is translated from the Hebrew,
but the translation is free and paraphrastic. Turning now
for a moment to 2 Esdras, the point of chief importance here
is that the translation is a very literal one, it follows the
Hebrew text minutely and with almost painful accuracy,
sometimes giving renderings which are so close as to be
rather lacking in sense in their translated form. In his
comparison of the two Greek books Thackeray says: “The
two translations are of an essentially different character.
While the writer of Esdras B (2 Esdras) shows a slavish adherence
to the Hebrew, often transliterating his original, and
making no pretensions to style, Esdras A (the “Greek Ezra”)
is marked by a free style of translation, an elegant and
idiomatic Greek, a happy rendering of Hebraisms, and an
omission of difficulties, which make it a far more readable
book than the other. It was clearly intended for Greek
readers unacquainted with Hebrew. The writer was a
<i lang="fr">littérateur</i> in possession of a wide Greek vocabulary.”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>The central problem of our book is to ascertain the relationship
between it and the canonical Hebrew book, and
2 Esdras. How do the “Greek Ezra” and 2 Esdras stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
to one another? How comes it that both are contained
in the Septuagint? Do they both go back to the same
Hebrew original? These and other questions which suggest
themselves in studying the book are by no means easy to
answer, and very varying opinions are held by scholars; nor
does it appear that any solution offered is clear from objections
of some kind. To deal with these theories would be out
of the question here, for the discussion of them fills volumes<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>;
a few facts may, however, be enumerated which must be
taken into consideration in seeking to arrive at a conclusion.</p>

<p>(1) There are strong grounds for believing that the “Greek
Ezra” is of earlier date than 2 Esdras; in the Septuagint
it precedes the latter; Josephus uses it, and apparently
does not know of 2 Esdras; the writer of the “Greek
Ezra” utilizes Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah in such
a way as to suggest that these three formed one whole, and
had not yet been divided up; in 2 Esdras the “Hebrew
Ezra” is clearly a separate book. The Hebrew text which
underlies the “Greek Ezra” is often a purer, and therefore
in all probability an older, one than that represented in 2
Esdras. For these reasons we are justified in regarding the
“Greek Ezra” as of earlier date than 2 Esdras.</p>

<p>(2) The “Greek Ezra” and 2 Esdras often agree in small
details; and, what is more striking, they not infrequently
agree in deviating from the Hebrew. But, on the other
hand, there are many passages in which the “Greek Ezra”
follows the Hebrew more closely than 2 Esdras. Now,
seeing that one of the characteristics of 2 Esdras is that it
follows its Hebrew original in a slavish manner, one is led
to the conclusion that the Hebrew text underlying the
“Greek Ezra” varied considerably from that which is represented
in 2 Esdras. But how is one to account for the agreements
between the “Greek Ezra” and 2 Esdras, just mentioned?
We suggest that something of this kind took place:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span></p>

<p>That the Hebrew text which underlay those two books
respectively was not the same is clear; the “Greek Ezra”
represents a text differing in many respects from the Massoretic
text, and therefore in all probability an older one
in which Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah were all one book;
2 Esdras represents in the main the Massoretic text. A
Greek translation was made of the earlier Hebrew text,
before, that is to say, the Hebrew text became fixed. This
Greek translation was the immediate parent of our “Greek
Ezra.” In the meantime the revision of the Hebrew text
took place, and a translator translated this into Greek,
utilizing at the same time the original Greek translation;
this represents 2 Esdras. So that a different Hebrew text
lies ultimately at the base of the “Greek Ezra” and of 2
Esdras; nevertheless both have to recognize the parentage
of an intermediate Greek translation, which accounts for the
elements of agreement between them; while their differences
are accounted for because they were translated from different
Hebrew texts. The accompanying diagram will illustrate
the suggestion made:</p>

<p>This suggestion is a combination of those of Ewald<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> and
Sir H. H. Howorth.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> What has been said does not account
for all the difficulties; there is, for example, the piece iii.
1-v. 3 to be accounted for; and the historical inaccuracies
(see next section) constitute another difficulty. Much can,
however, be explained by recognizing, what seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
an undoubted fact, that a redactor has been at work on our
book, but has not finished his work; there seems to have
been a special purpose which this redactor had in view (see
section V) and he was concerned with this more than with
historical accuracy. The difficulties are enhanced by the
fact that the abrupt beginning and ending show that the
book is incomplete in its present form.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Historicity of the Book</span></h4>

<p>In discussing the question of the historical character of
our book it is obviously necessary to take the “Hebrew
Ezra” and Nehemiah into account; and it will help us to
some extent in seeking to find our way about the hopelessly
intricate historical maze in which we soon become involved
if we begin by drawing up a chronological table. We will,
however, preface this with the following list of Persian kings;
the names which are put in square brackets do not concern
us, but they are added for completeness’ sake:</p>

<p class="noindent pad1">
Cyrus, as king of Persia, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 538-529.<br>

Artaxerxes I, Longimanus, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 465-426.<br>
</p>

<p>Now we give a chronological list of events with the references

<hr class="tb">

<p>On comparing the history of the “Greek Ezra” with that
of Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah the two most prominent
points to be noted are that, (1) the “Greek Ezra” makes
the order of the Persian kings the reverse of what that order
actually was, viz., Artaxerxes (ii. 15-25), Darius (iii. 1-v. 6),
Cyrus (v. 7-70), while Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah has the
right order. It is, however, well to remember that the
“Greek Ezra” in ii. 1 ff. begins the list in the right order,
namely, with Cyrus. And (2) the “Greek Ezra” takes no
account of Nehemiah i. 1-vii. 72, but gives the history as
recorded in Ezra vii.-x., Nehemiah vii. 73-viii. 12; so that
the “Greek Ezra” does not present the gap of fourteen
years found in Ezra-Nehemiah, for it makes the history of
Ezra continuous.</p>

<p>As regards the first of these two points, it is evident that
the writer of the “Greek Ezra” was not unaware of the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
that the events were in their wrong order, otherwise we
should not have found Cyrus mentioned first, as in ii. 1 ff.,
and Artaxerxes last, as in viii. 1 ff. An important fact in
this connection is that Josephus, who follows the “Greek
Ezra” and not 2 Esdras with its literal translation of the
“Hebrew Ezra,” has “Cambyses” instead of “Artaxerxes,”
thus getting the order correct; and, in following the text
of the “Greek Ezra,” he has a consistent chronology. But
the contents of the passage in question (ii. 16-30) show that
the <em>position</em> in which it stands must be wrong because it
speaks of the interruption of the building of the Temple
before the foundation is begun. So that if Josephus did not
himself alter “Artaxerxes” to “Cambyses,” which is very
improbable, he must have found it in the source he had
before him; in this case a redactor or compiler altered the
name, desiring to get the names of the Persian kings in their
right order. But if this is so it suggests the fact that in the
original translation of the book the chronology was inconsistent,
in which case the same must be true of the Hebrew
text which the translator had before him. Now when we
look at the Hebrew text of Ezra-Nehemiah we find that it,
too, contains historical inaccuracies of a serious character,
and that there has clearly been a considerable manipulation
of the text. What seems, therefore, to be pretty clear is
that there were several different Hebrew records of the
history of the people since the Return, and that the knowledge
of this history was hazy; but that finally an authoritative,
revised, Hebrew form was made in which the general
uncertainty regarding the historical events is strongly
reflected; not only so, but for particular purposes (see next
section) certain aspects of the history were emphasized,
while others were treated more scantily; the final result
being that before any Greek translation was made there
were two, at least, Hebrew accounts of the history both
characterized by a particular tendency, and both characterized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
by historical inaccuracies. Our two Greek versions
represent these two Hebrew (or Hebrew-Aramaic) forms.
But it does not follow that the historicity of either of these
was superior to the other; in this matter each has something
to contribute. A striking example of the way in which the
“Greek Ezra” sometimes shows its superiority is the second
point referred to above; in this case the Ezra story is more
logical, differing from the canonical account by making
Ezra vii.-x. to be immediately followed by Nehemiah vii.
73-viii. 12.</p>

<p>There are many other differences between the “Greek
Ezra” and the canonical books, details of which would be
out of place here, but the two given illustrate the main
point regarding the historicity of our book which we wish
to emphasize, namely, that its historical value is, at the lowest
estimate, on a level with that of its canonical rival; each
has many inaccuracies, but each has something to contribute;
to use one without the other in dealing with the
history of the period would be a great mistake. “It can
no longer be assumed,” Cook rightly points out, “that the
Massoretic text necessarily represents a more trustworthy
record of the age, and that <em>E</em> (= the “Greek Ezra”) is
necessarily arbitrary and methodless. Both share fundamental
imperfections. <em>E</em>, therefore, in any case deserves
impartial consideration, and its problems involve those of
Ezra-Nehemiah. These problems, owing to the absence
of decisive and independent evidence, can be handled only
provisionally; but enough is clear to permit the conclusion
that <em>E</em> represents a text in some respects older than
the <em>present</em> Massoretic text, to which, however, some attempt
seems to have been made to conform it.... From a comparison
of both with Josephus and other sources (notably
Daniel) it would further appear that <em>E</em> represents one of the
efforts to give an account of a period, the true course of
which was confused and forgotten, if not intentionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
obscured; different attempts were made to remove difficulties
and inconsistencies, and the desire to give greater
prominence to the priestly Ezra than to the secular governor
Nehemiah is probably responsible for the arrangement of
the extant texts.”<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Purpose of the Book</span></h4>

<p>It is an open question as to what the special purpose was
which the writer of the original Hebrew work had in his
mind; one might at first naturally suppose that it was the
same as the writer of any other Jewish historical book,
namely to give the history of the particular period dealt
with. But assuming, as we may justly do, that our Greek
translation gives, upon the whole, an equivalent of the
Hebrew that lay before it, it is not difficult to discern a special
tendency at work in it. In the first place, political history
is quite relegated to the background; but great stress is
laid upon everything that has to do with worship and ritual,
the re-instatement of the sacrificial system and of the priests
and their duties, the due support of the priests, the return
of the holy vessels of the sanctuary, the celebration of the
festivals, and the purification of the congregation. In addition
to this, it is the rebuilding of the Temple which is
emphasized, while the rebuilding of the city walls takes
quite a secondary place. It is pretty evident, therefore,
that the object which the writer had in view was not so
much that of giving the history of his people during the
post-exilic period, but rather to set forth the paramount
importance of the worship of the Temple. In the second
place, and closely connected with this, is the further purpose
of presenting Ezra as the one really important person who
figures in Jewish post-exilic history, and with his name was,
of course, indissolubly connected the Law, of which he
was the great champion. The title of the book, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
implies its purpose. All this is in accordance with what
we know to have been characteristic of the attitude of the
Jewish religious leaders during the late post-exilic period.
In the original form of the Hebrew this was in all probability
not so to the same extent, but that original was worked over
in the interests of the school of thought just referred to;
so that the actual form of the Hebrew which lay before
the Greek translator was not the original form in which the
book was written. The present title was a subsequent
addition.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_VI">VI. <span class="smcap">The Story of the Three Young Men of Darius’
Bodyguard</span></h4>

<p>A few words about this section of our book is needed both
because, according to some scholars, it is closely connected
with the purpose for which our book was written, and also
because it is the part which is peculiar to the “Greek Ezra.”
It occurs in iii. 1-v. 6,<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and is briefly as follows:</p>

<p>Three young men of Darius’ bodyguard undertake to
enter upon a competition as to which of them shall be able
to put forth a “sentence which shall seem wiser” than those
of the other two; it seems to be taken for granted that the
successful one will be richly rewarded by the king. They,
therefore, wrote their sentences and sealed them, and laid them
“under the king his pillow.” The king and the three princes
of Persia are to be the judges as to which is the wisest of the
three sentences, these being: “Wine is the strongest”;
“The king is strongest”; “Women are strongest, but above
all things Truth beareth away the victory” (iii. 1-12).
Then the king, having had these sentences placed before
him, calls upon all the state officials to assemble, while he
sits in the seat of judgement, so that all may hear the
explanations of their sentences which the three young men
are invited to give (iii. 13-17). The first seeks to establish
the truth of his sentence by showing that its power is uniform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
over all men; it affects all alike in that it enforces them to
forget (iii. 17<i>b</i>-24). The second, by pointing to the unlimited
power of the king over his subjects who obey his
every command, maintains that the king is the strongest
(iv. 1-12). The third, who, it is added in parenthesis, is
Zerubbabel, speaks at greater length; he deals first with
women, and shows that though the king is great, and wine
is strong, yet “Women have borne the king and all the
people that bear rule by sea and land. Even of them came
they; and they nourished up them that planted the vineyards,
from whence the wine cometh.” Man’s succumbing
to the fascination of woman, and therefore her superior
power, is the theme of the verses that follow (iv. 13-32).
The second part of his oration is concerned with truth, and
it contains some really fine sentences: “O sirs, are not
women strong? (Yet) great is the earth, high is the heaven,
swift is the sun in its course, for it compasseth the heavens
round about, and fetcheth its course again to its own place
in one day—is <em>He</em> not great that maketh these things?
Therefore great is truth, and stronger than all things....
Truth abideth, and is strong for ever; she liveth and conquereth
for evermore.... Blessed be the God of Truth.”
And then all the people shouted and said: “Great is truth,
and strong above all things”; in the Latin Version: <i lang="la">Magna
est veritas, et praevalet</i> (iv. 13-41). Needless to say, the last
speaker is the winner, and he receives the king’s reward.
But the curious part is that here we suddenly get transported
into an entirely different region of thought, for on the king
desiring him to make some further request over and above
what had been originally settled, he replies: “Remember
thy vow, which thou didst vow to build Jerusalem, in the
day when thou camest to thy kingdom, and to send away
all the vessels that were taken out of Jerusalem....
Thou didst also vow to build up the temple ...” (iv. 42-46).
Then the king gives orders that all this is to be carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
out (iv. 47-57). The young man (he is not again referred
to as Zerubbabel) offers up a prayer of thanksgiving (iv.
58-63); the return of the exiles commences (v. 1-6).</p>

<p>Now, one can scarcely fail to perceive that the whole
section, from iv. 41 to the end, does not really belong to the
original story of the three young men; or rather, one should
say that this story does not belong to the context in which
it now stands, or indeed to the historical record at all of
which our book is a compilation, for its presence creates
great chronological confusion. The words in iv. 13, spoken
in reference to the third young man, “this was Zerubbabel,”
do not belong there; they were added later to the story,
but they are important because they point to the reason
why this story was interpolated into the historical compilation.
As we have seen, the whole purpose of our book, in
the form in which we now have it, was to lay stress on ritual
and worship, and to place the person and work of Ezra in
the foreground; this reflects the orthodox and legalistic
Pharisaic attitude. An attempt to counterbalance this
was made by a Hellenistic Jew who inserted the story of the
three young men (whether his own composition, or taken from
some collection of stories does not affect the point), and
added the words “this is Zerubbabel” for the purpose of
bringing into prominence this personality, and thereby
making Ezra and all which his name connoted not the sole
important issue in Jewry. Zerubbabel, it will be remembered,
was the great instrument of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah
(see Hag. i., ii., Zech. iv.); he represented, therefore, the
prophetical ideals expressed, for example, in such words as:
“Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the
Lord of Hosts” (Zech. iv. 6), as against the legalism of Ezra
and the school that followed him, above all his disciples, the
Pharisees, in the post-Maccabæan period.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be added that this story did not belong
to the Hebrew even in its latest form; it was in all probability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
written in Greek by a Hellenistic Jew; yet the
possibility of an Aramaic original is not excluded. If it
could be proved that Hebrew or Aramaic was the original
language of this addition, and that Palestine was its home,
the interesting theory might then be put forth that it, together
with the inserted words “this is Zerubbabel,” was
added by a Sadducee in opposition to Pharisaism; Zerubbabel’s
close connection with the high-priest (see Hag. i. 12,
14, ii. 2, 4, and all Zech. iv.) would fully explain the reason
of the inserted words. But whichever view be correct the
main purpose of the addition would be the same, viz. an
attempt to counteract the influence of Pharisaism.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHVIII_VII">VII. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Book</span></h4>

<p>Very few words are needed in speaking of the date of our
book, or rather, of its compilation. To fix the date of the
original documents made use of by the compiler of the
Hebrew form is not in question here. If we inquire as to the
date of the Hebrew form which lay before the Greek translator
it must be replied that this depends upon what that
form was; if it contained the marks of what may be called
the “Ezra-tendency,” then it must probably be post-Maccabæan,
in which case our present Greek translation
might fairly be dated not later than the middle of the last
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>But if the Hebrew did not contain these marks—we refer
especially to the passage dealt with in the preceding section—and
they are due to the Greek translator or a redactor,
which we believe more probable, then the Hebrew, even in
the form in which it lay before the translator, was pre-Maccabæan,
and the Greek form, though post-Maccabæan,
might well be dated about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 100. It is to this latter
date that we incline; and it is corroborated by considerations
of vocabulary, as has been well shown by Dewick.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<h4 id="PII_CHIX_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Title and Authorship of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">The title “The Wisdom of Solomon” in the English
Versions comes from the Greek manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> the
three oldest of which have this exact title, while, in one form
or another, they <em>all</em> have it. But the Old Latin Version has
only “The Book of Wisdom,” without any mention of
Solomon; and the Syriac Version, while ascribing it to
Solomon, adds, “of which there is a doubt; whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
another wise man of the Hebrews wrote it in a prophetic
spirit, putting it in the name of Solomon, and it was received.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
Although some of the early Latin Fathers
believed that the book was the work of Solomon, they formed
the exceptions; it is obvious that it cannot have been
written by him, as we shall see as we proceed. But it may
well be asked why it should have been ascribed to Solomon;
the usual and obvious answer that to the Jews Solomon was
the wisdom-writer <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, and that therefore anyone
desiring to commend a book on wisdom would naturally
choose this name as a pseudonym in preference to any other,
is doubtless correct in a general way; but Plumptre has
suggested a stronger reason; believing that the book was
written in antagonism to Ecclesiastes,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> he says: “Let us
remember in what light it [i.e. Ecclesiastes] must have
presented itself to him [i.e. the writer of Wisdom]. It had
not ... the claim which comes from the reverence due to
the authority of a remote antiquity or an unquestioned
acceptance. He must have known that it had not been
received as canonical without serious opposition, that the
strictest school of the Pharisees had been against its reception,
that it had seemed to them tainted with the heresy of Epicuræanism
and Sadduceeism. If it was interpreted then as it
has often been interpreted since, it may have seemed to him
to sanction a lawless sensuality, to fall in with the thoughts
of those who said, ‘let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
die,’ and to throw doubt, if not denial, on the soul’s immortality.
Was this, he seems to have asked himself, the true
ideal of wisdom? Was it not his duty to bring before men
another Solomon than that whose experience seemed to end
in materialism and pessimism, in the scepticism of an endless
doubt? And so he, too, adopts without any hesitation the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
form of personated authorship.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> This puts the matter
on a higher plane altogether. That the writer of our book
had what he considered to be the erroneous teaching of
Ecclesiastes in mind will be clear to any one who reads
Wisdom ii. 1-9 in conjunction with the following passages
from Ecclesiastes:<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>In Wisdom ii. 1 ff. (“For they said within themselves,
reasoning not aright ...”) the writer is describing the
tenets of the ungodly; and what he says agrees not only in
substance, but often even verbally, with the corresponding
passages in Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>Bearing Plumptre’s words in mind, therefore, and remembering
what has been said above<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> regarding the estimate
of the function and importance of authorship among Easterns
of earlier times, we should not be justified in seeing any
fraudulent intention on the part of our author in putting
the name of Solomon to the title of his book.</p>

<p>As to the personality of the author<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> but very few <em>data</em>
are to be gathered from the book; he must in all probability
have been a Jew (cp. xii. 22), but a Hellenistic Jew, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span>
loyal to the Law<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> (xviii. 4), who lived and wrote in Egypt
(see xii. 23 ff., xv. 18, 19, xvi. 1, 9, where reference is made to
Egyptian animal-worship); his Jewish feeling is evidenced
throughout the book; that he was domiciled in Alexandria is
highly probable, for this was the centre of Jewish-Hellenistic
culture. As Gregg well points out, the author “makes no
effort to disguise his sympathy with Hellenic thought. He
is a Euhemerist in his account of the origin of idol-worship
(xiv.); he is a Platonist in his sense of the beauty of the
world, and in his argument that its beauty points to a
supreme First Cause. He draws on Plato for his doctrine
of pre-existing matter (xi. 17), of the pre-existence of the
soul (viii. 19), and of the body as an obstacle in the path
to spiritual knowledge (ix. 15). The teaching of the
Stoics suggested to him the penetratingness of Wisdom (vii.
24), and her quickness of understanding (vii. 22). The
doctrine of Providence (xiv. 3) and the conception of the
four cardinal virtues (viii. 7), were a loan partly from Plato
and partly from the Stoics. This combination of knowledge
of Egypt and sympathy with Greek studies points
plainly to Alexandria; and the inference is strengthened
by a comparison of Wisdom with the writings of the Alexandrian
Philo. For the affinity between them is so close, that
the author has been styled a pre-Philonic Philonist. Like
Philo (but in a more uncompromising way), he is a Jew
loyal to the national religion; and no centre offered the
same opportunities as did Alexandria for a Jew who wished
to unite a liberal eclecticism with his traditional faith.”<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
For the influence of Greek philosophy to be discerned in the
book see <a href="#PI_CHAPTER_IV">Part I, Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIX_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Date of the Book</span></h4>

<p>Among modern scholars controversy regarding the date of
our book centres round the question as to whether it belongs
to the middle of the last century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or about a hundred
years later, though some (e.g. Gregg, <i>Op. cit.</i>, p. xi.) would
date it as early as “within the last quarter of the second
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>” There are three main points to be taken into
consideration in seeking to fix an approximate date.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The author quotes from the Septuagint of the Book
of Isaiah (ii. 12, cp. Isa. iii. 10, and xv. 10, cp. Isa. xliv. 20),
and also from the Book of Job (xii. 12, cp. Job ix. 12, 19);
therefore these books must have already existed in their
Greek form. Now from the Prologue to Ecclesiasticus it is
evident that the prophetical books had been translated into
Greek before Sirach’s grandson translated his grandfather’s
work, and that therefore these books formed part of the
Septuagint before <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 132.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> But as regards the Book of
Job, and the <cite>Hagiographa</cite> generally,<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> we cannot say with
any certainty at what precise period they were translated<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>;
Swete, after reviewing the evidence, says: “Thus while the
testimony of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> does not absolutely require
us to believe that all the books of the Hebrew canon
had been translated and were circulated in a Greek version
during the Apostolic age, such a view is not improbable;
and it is confirmed by the fact that they are all contained
in the canon of the Greek Bible which the Christian Church
received from its Jewish predecessors.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The fact, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
that the author of Wisdom quotes from the Book of
Job in its Greek form makes it reasonably certain that our
book was written during the last century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The next point is as to the historical conditions reflected
in the book. Quite recently Goodrick has examined
this question with great care, and it is one which needs a
brief consideration. Rightly or wrongly, it is often taken
for granted that the book was written at a time when the
Jews were suffering, or had recently suffered, persecution;
such passages as ii. 10-20, vi. 5-9 are supposed to be references
to this. What persecution is it, then, to which reference
is made? Goodrick believes that the allusion is to a
persecution under Caligula (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 37-41). After giving the
historical details, he sums up as follows: “A sore persecution
has just been endured; a persecution not to the death
indeed, but involving grave damage and distress. This
persecution, founded in part on gross calumny, had as one
of its main features the attempted enforcement of idolatry,
and of idolatry in its most insane and revolting form—the
worship of a living man. This living man was a prince
ruling at a distance, but his commands were enforced by
apostate Jews dwelling close at hand, who had surrendered
their ancient belief without sincerely adopting any other,
and represented no religion except that of Epicureanism,
for which they sought to find their text-book in the so-called
Solomon’s ‘Preacher.’ This persecution had been carried
on through the agency of the dregs of the populace of
Alexandria, wherein were represented the superstition of
ancient Egypt at its worst, combined with hereditary Greek
hatred of the Jews, and wild misrepresentation of their
religion and ordinances. Finally, a time of temporary
repose must be pictured, in which it was possible to substitute
severe rebuke for furious complaint. All these conditions
the period from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 41 to 44 presents, and an
examination of the Book of Wisdom confirms the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
it was then written.”<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> In support of this Goodrich refers
first to ii. 10-20, where the ungodly say “within themselves,
reasoning not aright” (see ii. 1):<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p class="noindent fs90">
10. Let us oppress the righteous poor;<br>
<span class="pad2">Let us not spare the widow,</span><br>
<span class="pad2">Nor reverence the grey hairs of the old man full of years.</span><br>

11. But let our strength be to us a law of righteousness,<br>
<span class="pad2">For weakness is condemned as unprofitable.</span><br>

12. But let us lie in wait for the righteous, for he is useless to us,<br>
<span class="pad2">And is opposed to our doings,</span><br>
<span class="pad2">And upbraideth us for sins against the Law,</span><br>
<span class="pad2">And denounceth to us sins against our discipline.</span><br>

13. For he professeth to have knowledge of God,<br>
<span class="pad2">And calleth himself the servant of the Lord.</span><br>

14. He became for us a rebuke to our machinations;<br>

15. He is grievous unto us even to look upon,<br>
<span class="pad2">Because his life is unlike other men’s,</span><br>
<span class="pad2">And his ways are peculiar.</span><br>

16. As base metal were we accounted by him,<br>
<span class="pad2">And he abstaineth from our ways as from uncleanness.</span><br>
<span class="pad2">He calleth the latter end of the righteous blessed,</span><br>
<span class="pad2">And vaunteth that God is his Father.</span><br>

17. Let us see if his words be true.<br>
<span class="pad2">Yea, and make trial of what will happen at his going forth.</span><br>

18. For if the righteous man be God’s son, He will uphold him,<br>
<span class="pad2">And will deliver him out of the hand of them that rise up against him.</span><br>

19. With insult and torture let us test him,<br>
<span class="pad2">That we may know his tolerance,</span><br>
<span class="pad2">And judge of his endurance of evil.</span><br>

20. Let us condemn him to a shameful death,<br>
<span class="pad2">So shall there be made examination of him from his own words.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Goodrick maintains that we have here the description of
the oppression of the righteous man. Of the calumnies which
had instigated the persecution, “that which had obtained
the widest circulation ... was that of the hatred of the
Jews for all mankind except their own nation. It is probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
alluded to in ii. 15, and is controverted in xii. 19”
(“... the righteous must be a lover of mankind”). Further,
he says that the allusion to the deification of living men is
plain in xiv. 16, 17:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then in time, being enforced, the impious custom was kept as a law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by the commands of despots graven images were worshipped,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom men, not being able to honour in their presence, through dwelling at a distance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Counterfeiting their features far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made a visible image of the honoured king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To flatter by their zeal the absent as present (cp. also vi. 2).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, the most striking reference to contemporary
matters, says Goodrick, is “that in xix. 5 as to the rights of
citizenship”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But these with feastings</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(First) welcoming <em>them that already shared the same rights</em>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Vexed them with sore labours.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Regarding the question of historical conditions by itself
Goodrick’s contention as to the date of our book is weighty;
but even so his arguments do not necessarily carry conviction.
It is not necessary, as Toy points out, “to suppose
that the work was composed in the midst of one of the
violently hostile movements. The author, even if he lived
in a relatively quiet time, would know enough of the general
fortunes of his people to paint his pictures of suffering (ii.-v.,
xiv.). Nor is his reference to the worship of the statues of
kings (xiv. 16-20) chronologically decisive, for divine worship
was paid to Ptolemy I, and probably to Antiochus II,
as well as to Caligula and other Roman emperors. The
author is, in fact, as Grimm remarks, giving a learned
account of the origin of idolatry, and it is unnecessary to
assume that the deified princes to whom he refers were his
contemporaries.”<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> It is also necessary to remember that
the command to worship the statue of Caligula meant the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
setting up of his effigy in the Temple at Jerusalem and in
the synagogues of Alexandria; is it likely that our author,
loyal and ardent Jew that he was, would use the mild language
that he does if it were a question of such a supreme
outrage upon Jewish belief and practice?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) But there is another point to be taken into consideration
in discussing the date of our book, namely, whether
or not it is pre-Philonian. Diametrically opposed views
are held by scholars; Schürer (<i>Op. cit.</i>, II, iii. p. 234)
regards it as certain that our book precedes Philo, for “his
standpoint is a preliminary step to Philo’s.” This, as he
says, would not in itself prove a higher antiquity; “but
with the near affinity of the two it is inconceivable that our
author would have remained unaffected by Philo if he had
succeeded him.” Farrar (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 421) says that the
impression left on his mind is that “the book was composed
in the Roman epoch, and by an author who was familiar
with the speculations of Philo, but regarded them from a
completely independent point of view. The impression
that he was to some extent influenced by the views of Philo,
and that Philo was not influenced by him, is very strong.
If he had preceded Philo, some traces of the powerful style
and individuality and phraseology of the Pseudo-Solomon
must surely have been observable in the voluminous pages
of the Jewish Theosophist.” Goodrick, while agreeing
with Farrar that the author of our book regarded the
speculations from a completely independent point of view,
does not think that there is the slightest reference or allusion
in either from either. While it is, so far, true that, as Goodrick
says, “we are left to the <i lang="la">à priori</i> conjectures of scholars,”
there is one important point, emphasized by Gregg, which
seems conclusive; Gregg writes (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. xii.): “In spite
of the remarkable similarity (in some cases amounting almost
to identity) of the language of Philo and that of Wisdom,
there is one vital difference which points to a considerably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
earlier date for the latter. The Logos-idea is the leading
feature of Philo’s system, and there is in Wisdom no trace
of the Philonian Logos, nor is the Divine Wisdom ever even
identified with the Logos. In Philo’s time the Logos-doctrine
must have belonged to current Alexandrian thought;
had Philo been its originator, he would have asserted it in a
more polemical manner. Accordingly, time must be allowed
for the development of a doctrine which Philo found ready
to hand, and that length of time must have separated the
composition of Wisdom from the writings of Philo. The
inference is (see Grimm, <cite>Intr.</cite>, p. 34), that Wisdom was
composed a considerable time, perhaps a century, before
Philo, who was born about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 20, began to write.” This
is a strong argument, though it does not seem necessary to
date our book as much as a century before the time of Philo.
Holmes grants the validity of Gregg’s argument (which is
also that of Grimm), though, as he says, “it only means
that the book must be earlier than the student-life of Philo,
which may be placed from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 5-<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 5.... But ignorance
of the Alexandrine Logos-doctrine can only affect the date
of the first part of the book; the second part may with
Bousset (<cite lang="fr">Religion des Judenthums</cite>, p. 35) be dated after the
beginning of the Empire (say <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 30), on account of xiv.
17, where the likeness of an <em>absent</em> ruler is mentioned” (<i>Op.
cit.</i>, p. 521). All things considered, the most probable date
would seem to be the latter half of the last century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
the earlier half of the book belonging to the beginning, the
later half to the end, of this period.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIX_III">III. <span class="smcap">The Question of Composite Authorship</span></h4>

<p>The question of the unity, or otherwise, of the book is
a difficult one; the arguments used in support of either
position are strong; anyone who reads them all would,
we should imagine, hesitate to pronounce a definite opinion
unless he had some new argument to present on one side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
or the other.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> We shall briefly enumerate the reasons which
have led many scholars to believe that the book is of composite
authorship. Upon one point all authorities are
agreed, whether they accept the unity of the book or not,
namely, that it is divided into two distinct parts: ii.-xi. 1, and
xi. 2-xix. It is the differences of various kinds between
these two parts which have suggested composite authorship;
these are as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The conception of God; in part I God’s action is
represented in a way quite different from that taught in
part II; this will be seen from the few following quotations
from each part. In vii. 22-viii. 1 Wisdom is spoken of in
such a way as to show that God acts <em>indirectly</em> through it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">... Beneficent, loving toward man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Steadfast, sure, free from care;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All-powerful, all-surveying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And penetrating through all spirits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That are quick of understanding; pure, subtil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For Wisdom is more mobile than any motion;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, she pervadeth and penetrateth all things by reason of her pureness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For she is a breath of the power of God ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... For she is an effulgence from everlasting light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And an unspotted mirror of the working of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And an image of His goodness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And she, though but one, hath power to do all things ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... But she reacheth from one end of the world to the other with full strength,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And ordereth all things well (cp. also x. 1 ff.).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again in viii. 6 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who more than Wisdom is an artificer of the things that are?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is clear enough from these passages that the Divine action<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
is represented as being accomplished through the agency
of Wisdom. In contrast to this God’s action is represented
as <em>direct</em> in part II; for example, in xv. 1 we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Thou, our God, art gracious and true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same truth is taught in xiii. 1:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For by nature all men were foolish, and had no perception of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And from the good things to be seen had not power to know Him that is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither by giving honour to the works did they recognize the Artificer.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Another thing which is believed to point to a difference
of authorship is that in part I Wisdom plays a most important
<i lang="fr">rôle</i>, whereas in part II it is never mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> This is
rather striking, especially when taken in conjunction with
what has been said in (<i>a</i>), for so many opportunities occur
in part II for Wisdom to be mentioned; in a number of
passages it might have found a place very naturally. For
an author who has such an exalted conception of Wisdom
as the writer of part I, it certainly strikes one as strange
to find that he suddenly ignores it altogether in part II;
whereas if the latter was of different authorship no problem
presents itself.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Further, the generally broad outlook of part I stands
in striking contrast to the pronounced particularism of the
second part. This in itself is, of course, not sufficient to
decide the question of authorship in favour of duality any
more than the other arguments put forth; but the
cumulative effect of all cannot be ignored; and this is
emphasized by one more, perhaps the strongest, argument,
viz.:</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Stylistic and linguistic differences. In part I the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
style is “relatively simple and direct, with constant regard
to the Hebrew principle of parallelism, whilst, in the second
part, it is ambitious, grandiloquent, or turgid, complicated
and artificial, often without parallelism.”<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> With
regard to the linguistic differences Holmes<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> has recently
made a careful examination of them, and the results he
gives are not to be ignored; they are far too detailed and
technical to be dealt with here. But his own conclusion is that
the difference in style, presentation and tone, together with
those of language and diction, taken together with other
problems which present themselves, are such that “there
are considerable difficulties in the way of accepting the unity
of authorship which have not been met by its upholders.
If we could assume that the writer of the second part had
studied the first part carefully, and wished to write a supplement
to it, both resemblances and differences could be
accounted for.”</p>

<p>But the arguments in favour of dual authorship have not
been ignored by the champions of unity of authorship;
their position has been well summed up by Toy thus: “It
may be said that a logical unity [between the two parts]
is recognizable in the fact that the two points of attack in
the work, apostasy and idolatry, represent the two great
enemies of the later devout Judaism, and that a consciousness
of unity is shown in ix. 18, which makes the transition
from the first part to the second,<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and has not the appearance
of an editorial insertion; that the similarity between
i. 1 and vi. 1 suggests that the same speaker is intended
throughout; that the non-mention of Wisdom after xi. 1
is due to the fact that the author became so immersed in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
historical sketch (which he meant as an indictment of his
own contemporaries) that he forgot the philosophical thesis
with which he set out; that the change of style is a natural
consequence of the change of the subject-matter, the moral
and philosophical discussions falling more easily into the
form of the Book of Proverbs, the dramatic scenes of the
earlier history readily suggesting legendary touches and
highly-coloured language; and that there are marked
resemblances of tone and style in the two parts—e.g. the
rush of thoughts of the second part is paralleled in the
description of the wicked (v.) and of Wisdom (vii. 22-viii. 1),
and the religiously elevated and dignified tone of the first
part appears here and there in the second (cp. i. 13-15,
ix. 1-6 with xi. 23-26, xii. 19, xvi. 7).” There is a great
deal in what is here said; it cannot be denied that it is
very difficult to come to a definite conclusion where the
arguments on both sides are so strong. At the same time
it is worth remembering that some writers who advocate
unity of authorship recognize that their position is not
impregnable; Eichhorn, for example, was so struck by the
differences between the two parts that although he believed
both were written by the same author he nevertheless thought
that the second was written in his youth, the former in
maturer years. Similarly, in one of the most recent commentaries
on the book, that of Goodrick, the author says:
“it is possible that a writer who had laid aside his work,
dictated in the beginning by irritation at apostasy and
persecution, gave it a new colour by adapting it to philosophic
ideas which he had only lately assimilated, and, its original
interest having passed with the times of persecution which
suggested it, should endeavour to obtain a vogue for it by the
direct ascription of it to Solomon.”<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Goodrick is convinced
of the unity of authorship, but thinks that the “Solomonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
chapters” (vii.-ix.) were added after the rest of the book
had been completed.</p>

<p>The possibilities of what the original facts of the case
may have been are numerous; upon the whole, while fully
recognizing the difficulties which surround the question, we
do not feel convinced that the advocates of unity of authorship
have established their view beyond possibility of doubt.
Dual authorship seems to us the easier and more natural
solution, though we are not blind to the fact that the easier
way is not always the right one.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIX_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Purposes for which the Book was Written</span></h4>

<p>Whether our book was written by a single author, or
whether each of the two parts were of different authorship
(see above, <a href="#PII_CHIX_III">§ III</a>), is immaterial so far as the aims and objects
of the book are concerned; for there is no doubt that it
was of Jewish authorship and that is was written for Jews<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>—Egyptian
Jews—who were beset by four special dangers,
viz. Scepticism, Materialism, Idolatry and Persecution.
That the writer of each part was a Jew we have already seen
(§ I); that the book was written for Jews is clear enough
from the fact that it contains numerous allusions to the past
history of Israel which are no more than allusions; it is
taken for granted that the readers understand them without
further explanation. Moreover, historical characters are again
and again spoken of without mentioning their names; it is
assumed that the readers will know who is meant since the
references are to persons who took a leading part in the
past history of Israel. It is, therefore, for the benefit of his
own people in Egypt, that the writer warns or encourages
or denounces, according to the particular danger combated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span></p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Scepticism.</i></p>

<p>The old problem of the godly in adversity and the wicked
in prosperity was evidently exercising the minds of many
Jews in Alexandria to the detriment of both their faith and
morals. Since there was no divine justice, and life was short,
they advocated making the most of life while they enjoyed
it, without considering others. The writer, in ii. 1-20,
describes the attitude of the wicked, putting into their
mouths the words which express this attitude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">Short and sorrowful is our life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there is no remedy when a man cometh to his end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And none was ever known that returned from Hades.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because by mere chance were we born,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And hereafter we shall be as though we had never been....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that now are;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And let us use creation with all earnestness as youth’s possession.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Let us oppress the righteous poor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us not spare the widow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor reverence the hairs of the old man grey for length of years....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We were accounted of him as base metal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he abstaineth from our ways as from uncleannesses.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The latter end of the righteous he calleth happy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he vaunteth that God is his father.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us see if his words be true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And let us try what shall befall in the ending of his life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For if the righteous man is God’s son He will uphold him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He will deliver him out of the hand of his adversaries....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This attitude the writer combats by asserting first that the
wicked will not escape punishment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore no man that uttereth unrighteous things shall be unseen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither shall Justice, when it punisheth, pass him by.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the counsels of the ungodly shall be searched out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the report of his words shall come unto the Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the punishment of his lawless deeds ... (i. 6-11).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the writer declares, further, that not only in this life
shall the wicked be punished, but in the next world as well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
while the godly will then be recompensed. He says of the
wicked that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">They knew not the mysteries of God,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Neither hoped they for wages of holiness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor did they judge that there is a prize for blameless souls.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because God created man for incorruption ... (ii. 21-24).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then follows the well-known passage concerning the
blessedness of the righteous:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the souls of the righteous are in the hands of God ... (iii. 1-9),</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in the verses that follow (iii. 10 ff.) the writer describes
the torment of the wicked in the world to come. The
true way to prepare in this world for the next is by the
acquisition of Wisdom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For her true beginning is desire of instruction;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the care for instruction is love of her;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And love of her is observance of her laws;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And to give heed to her laws is the assurance of incorruption;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And incorruption bringeth near to God;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So then the desire of Wisdom promoteth to a kingdom (vi. 17-20).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One purpose, therefore, of the book is to bring the godless
sceptics among the Jews to a better frame of mind; and
this is done mainly by setting forth the doctrine of immortality,
and retribution or reward in the world to come.</p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Materialism.</i></p>

<p>Closely connected with the preceding was a second danger,
that of Materialism, the combating of which was another
purpose that the writer had in view in writing his book.
In a passage already referred to, which contains the words
put by the writer into the mouth of the ungodly, the existence
of this danger is seen from the following words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And let no flower of spring pass us by.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they wither,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Let there be no meadow without traces of our proud revelry.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Everywhere let us leave tokens of our mirth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because this is our portion, and our lot is this (ii. 7-9).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For these materialists the writer has the same message as
for the sceptics:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The ungodly shall be requited as they reasoned (iii. 10).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had reasoned that fulness of this life’s enjoyment was
their portion and their lot; so it shall be; but they are
warned of what is to come hereafter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">They shall come, when their sins are reckoned up, with coward fear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And their lawless deeds shall convict them to their face (iv. 20; and cp. v. 1-14).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is by means of the doctrine of immortality that the writer
seeks to combat these dangers of scepticism and materialism.
The recognition of this truth of a life hereafter is wisdom
(see vi. 17-20 quoted above).</p>


<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Idolatry.</i></p>

<p>That a further object of the book is to utter a warning
against idolatry is obvious from what is said in chapters xiii.-xv.;
but whether the writer has in view mainly the Gentiles
among whom he was living or the renegades of his own race,
is differently answered by commentators. Probably both
are in the writer’s mind. At any rate, his polemic against
idolatry is very thorough; he regards it as the cause of all
kinds of evil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the devising of idols was the beginning of fornication,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the invention of them the corruption of life ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all things confusedly are filled with blood and murder, theft and deceit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disquieting of the good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ingratitude for benefits received,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Defiling of souls, confusion of sex.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Disorder in marriage, adultery and wantonness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the worship of those unnameable idols</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is the beginning and cause and end of every evil ... (xiv. 12-31).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From the words that follow it would seem that in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
passage, at any rate, it is apostate Jews which the writer has
in mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For their worshippers either make merry unto madness, or prophesy lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or live unrighteously, or lightly forswear themselves;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, putting their trust in lifeless idols,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They wickedly swear false oaths, and look not to be harmed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But for both sins shall the just doom pursue them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because they had evil thoughts of God by giving heed to idols,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And swore unrighteously in deceit, despising holiness ... (xiv. 28-31).</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For such a particularist as the writer of the second part
of our book the words, “because they had evil thoughts of
God” could only refer to apostate Jews, for he would not
contemplate the Egyptians with their animal-worship as
even thinking of God; the same would apply to the words
“despising holiness.”</p>


<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Persecution.</i></p>

<p>Lastly, the writer wrote with the purpose of comforting
and encouraging his people in face of persecution which
they were suffering from the Egyptians; as Gregg rightly
points out, the Jews must have been suffering from pressure
from without, for “nothing else will account for the intensity
of the writer’s hatred of Egypt, which he gratifies as he
lingers over the bondage of the Israelites, and labours
the contrast between the fortunes of oppressors and oppressed
(x. 16 ff., xi. 1 ff., xvi.-xix.). History repeats itself,
and he regards the study of history as the best remedy for
national depression. If it was in respect of its divinities
that Egypt was smitten in the time of Moses, and if idolatry
is not only folly but the cause of all social and civic decadence
(xiii.-xv.), the suppressed conclusion is that the Egypt
which still harries the resident Jews and has not yet repented
of its beast-worship, will once again bend before
Israel.”<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHIX_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Influence of the Book on St. Paul</span></h4>

<p>There are a large number of passages in the Pauline Epistles
in which the influence of our book is to be discerned; to
quote all the passages from Wisdom and the corresponding
ones in the Epistles would be out of the question here; but a
few examples may be given in order to show how necessary
the study of this book is for the New Testament student.</p>

<p>In ii. 23, 24 a doctrine of the Fall is touched upon which
reflects the Jewish ideas on the subject current at the time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Because God created man for incorruption,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And made him an image of His own proper being;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But by the envy of the devil <em>death entered into the world</em>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they that belong to his realm experience it.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With these words should be compared the two following
passages: Romans v. 12, “Therefore, as through one
man <em>sin entered into the world, and death through sin</em>; and
so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned”; cp. 1
Corinthians xv. 21, 22.</p>

<p>In iii. 8 it is said of the righteous departed that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">They shall judge nations, and have dominion over peoples;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the Lord shall reign over them for evermore.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This reminds one forcibly of St. Paul’s words in 1
Corinthians vi. 2, 3:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world...?
know ye not that we shall judge angels...?</p>
</div>

<p>In both these cases it is, of course, possible that the similarity
exists solely because in both sets of passages current
Jewish ideas find expression; in the following one, however,
it is difficult to believe that it did not influence St. Paul
when he wrote the well-known words in Ephesians vi. 11-20,
beginning: “Put on the whole armour of God”; the passage
in Wisdom is v. 17-20:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall take His jealousy as complete armour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shall make the whole creation His weapons for vengeance upon His enemies:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shall take judgement unfeigned as a helmet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall take holiness as an invincible shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shall sharpen stern wrath as a sword.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is probable that the writer of this had in mind Isaiah lix.
17: “And He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and
an helmet of salvation upon His head; and He put on
garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal
as a cloke”; but while this passage was no doubt the original
inspiration of both Wisdom v. 17-20 and Ephesians vi.
11-20, one cannot read these two latter without feeling
convinced that St. Paul knew and utilized the Book of
Wisdom. On the other hand, regarding the somewhat
intricate subject of “the elements of the world,” which is
referred to more than once both in Wisdom and by St.
Paul, while one would hesitate to assert definitely that the
latter was influenced by the former it offers a good illustration
of the need of studying St. Paul’s writings in the
light of this book. To show what we mean it will suffice to
put the respective passages in parallel columns, and the
reader will at once see the connection:</p>

    <div class="textcolx">
<p>Wisdom vii. 17: “For He hath
given me unerring knowledge
of the things that are, to
know the constitution of the
world, and the working of the
elements.”</p>

<p>Wisdom xix. 18-21: “For the
elements changed their order
one with another....”</p>

<p>Wisdom xiii. 2, 3: “But whether
fire, or wind, or swift air, or
circling stars, or raging water,
or luminaries of heaven, they
thought (all) were gods that
rule the world. And if
through delight in their beauty
they took them to be gods,
let them know how much
better than these is their
Sovereign Lord....”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textcolx">
<p>Colossians ii. 8: “Take heed lest
there shall be any one that
maketh spoil of you through
his philosophy and vain deceit,
after the tradition of
men, after the elements of
the world, and not after Christ.”</p>

<p>Colossians ii. 20: “If ye died with
Christ from the elements of the
world, seek the things that are
above, where Christ is....”</p>

<p>Galatians iv. 3: “So we also,
when we were children, were
held in bondage under the
elements of the world.”</p>

<p>Galatians iv. 8, 9: “Howbeit at
that time, not knowing God,
ye were in bondage to them
which by nature are no gods;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
but now that ye have come
to know God, or rather to be
known of God, how turn ye
back again to the weak and
beggarly elements, whereunto
ye desire to be in bondage over
again?” (cp. Heb. v. 12;
2 Pet. iii. 10, 12).</p>
    </div>

<p>Whatever may be meant here by “the elements of the
world,” it is clear that St. Paul is combating a false doctrine
regarding belief in elemental spirits; and for the study of
this subject recourse to the Book of Wisdom is imperative.
An interesting parallel is that between Wisdom ix. 15:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For a corruptible body weigheth down the soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the earthly frame lieth heavy on the mind that is full of cares,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and 2 Corinthians v. 1: “For we know that if the earthly
house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building
from ...,” and verse 4: “For indeed we that are in this
tabernacle do groan, being burdened....”</p>

<p>And once more, in Wisdom xi. 23 it is said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Thou hast mercy on all men, because Thou hast power to do all things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Thou overlookest the sins of men to the end that they may repent.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are at once reminded of St. Paul’s words in Romans
ii. 4: “Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance
and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness
of God leadeth thee to repentance?” (cp. Rom. xi. 32).</p>

<p>Still more striking is the following:</p>

    <div class="textcolx">
<p>Wisdom xv. 7: “For a potter,
kneading soft earth, laboriously
mouldeth each vessel for
our service: nay, out of the
same clay doth he fashion both
the vessels that minister to
clean uses, and those of a
contrary sort, all in like manner;
but what shall be the
use of either sort, the craftsman
himself is the judge.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textcolx">
<p>Romans ix. 21-23: “Or hath
not the potter a right over the
clay, from the same lump to
make one part a vessel unto
honour, and another unto
dishonour? What if God,
willing to show His wrath,
and to make His power known,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
endured with much long-suffering
vessels of wrath
fitted unto destruction; and
that He might make known
the riches of His glory upon
vessels of mercy...?”</p>
    </div>

<p>Space forbids us to do more than merely refer to other
striking resemblances and parallel passages which further
illustrate the influence of this book upon St. Paul, the three
following subjects would, however, repay careful study:
the qualities of Wisdom—with Wisdom vii. 22-viii. 1,
ix. 6-17 compare 1 Corinthians ii. 6-16; the doctrine of
Predestination—with Wisdom xii., xv. 7 compare Romans
ix. 19-23; the question of heathen idolatry—with Wisdom
xiii., xiv. compare Romans i. 18-32.</p>

<p>The number of parallels, in the words of Thackeray, “between
St. Paul and Wisdom put it beyond doubt that the
Apostle had at one time made a close study of the apocryphal
book. It was a book which no doubt had a wide circulation
at an early time, being the noblest product of the pre-Christian
Judaism of Alexandria, and combining in the choicest
language the broader views of Hellenism with the narrower
national spirit of Judaism: a combination which would
make it of special interest to the Apostle who sought to
make himself all things to all men that he might by all means
gain some. ‘A practical man with the sharp outlook for
practical needs, Paul took what was good wherever it offered
itself.’ The influence is rather formal than substantial.
But in three, not unimportant points, the Apostle’s views
on idolatry, on predestination and on eschatology, he has
been to some extent affected by the matter, and not only
the manner, of the Alexandrian work.”<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>For the further study of this subject the excellent book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
of Thackeray’s, just quoted, is invaluable, as is also Grafe’s
<cite lang="de">Das Verhältniss der Paulinischen Schriften zur Sapientia
Salomonis</cite> (1892); see also Sanday and Headlam’s <cite>Romans</cite>,
passim, and Hausrath, <cite lang="de">Der Apostel Paulus</cite>, p. 23 (1872).</p>

<p>It is probable that the influence of <cite>Wisdom</cite> is to be discerned
in other books of the New Testament; Gregg, <i>Op.
cit.</i>, pp. liv.-lvi., gives a long list of parallels between the
book and St. John’s Gospel; and for parallels with the
epistle of St. James, see the same author, pp. lix., lx. and
Mayor’s <cite>St. James</cite>, p. lxxv.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHX_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Origin of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">In chapter ii. 19-32 of our book the writer explains in a
preface the origin, contents and purpose of his work.
He tells us that an account of all the heroic doings of Judas
Maccabæus and his brothers had been drawn up by Jason
the Cyrenian in five books. He does not say anything
further about this Jason, and seems to take for granted
that his readers will know who is meant. Neither Jason
nor his work are mentioned elsewhere. However, as the
writer says, his book is an epitome of Jason’s larger work:
“These things, then, which have been made known by
Jason the Cyrenian, we will essay to epitomize in one volume”
(ii. 23). The writer says further in his preface (verses 30, 31):
“To enter into details, and to indulge in long discussions,
and to be curious in particulars, is the part of the original
author of the history; but to strive after brevity of expression,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
and to avoid a laboured fulness in the treatment,
must be granted to him who puts the material into a new
form.” These words plainly imply that the writer utilized
Jason’s history as his sole source, and that he confined himself
to an abridgement of what Jason had written. His
choice of excerpts was made on the principle that they must
be interesting; for, as he says a little earlier in his preface
(verses 24, 25): “For having in view the confused mass of
the numbers, and the weariness which awaiteth them that
would enter into the narratives of the history, by reason of
the abundance of the matter, we were careful that they who
choose to read may be attracted....” He desires, therefore,
to make his epitome popular by its attractiveness.</p>

<p>Judging from the book itself, it is evident that on the
whole the writer adheres to his intention of being simply
and solely an epitomist; that is to say, the words are as a
rule, but not always, copied straight from Jason, though
there are certainly cases where these are summarized. The
want of unity, and the rather haphazard way in which events
are jotted down, fully supports the writer in saying that he
is merely an epitomist. At the same time, the writer had, as
we shall see later, a special purpose of his own, owing to
which there are some exceptions to this general rule.</p>

<p>But since our book relies for its main facts almost solely
on Jason’s history, which is thus to a considerable extent
reflected in this later work, it is pertinent to inquire whether
any indications are to be discerned in it regarding the sources
which Jason used in compiling his history. That he cannot
have used the First Book of Maccabees will be seen when we
discuss the relationship between 1 and 2 Maccabees in a
later section. No indication of any other literary sources
are given in the book; and since Jason’s history cannot
have been written very long after the Maccabæan struggle
(probably <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 120-100), he must in all likelihood have composed
his history from oral sources. “The character of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
the history of which 2 Maccabees is the abridgement can
best be explained by supposing that its author was a contemporary
of men who had taken part in the Maccabæan
struggle; that he was obliged to depend mainly on oral
accounts; that he did not receive his information directly
from those who had themselves taken part in these events,
but only after it had passed through other hands; and that
he was often unequal to the task of criticizing and arranging
the material thus obtained.”<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>It is well to mention here, however, that the epitomizer
must in some instances have embellished and enlarged some
of the material he used (see below, <a href="#PII_CHX_III">§ III</a>); so that the question
has always to be kept in mind whether, and in how far,
the epitomizer touched up for his own purposes any given
passage.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_II">II. <span class="smcap">The Contents of the Book</span></h4>

<p>Prefixed to the book are two letters purporting to have
been addressed by the Jews of Palestine to their brethren
of the Dispersion; but as these have nothing to do with
the book itself, and are evidently not part of the original
work, they do not concern us at present, and will be dealt
with separately (§ VI).</p>

<p>The period of history covered by the book begins shortly
before the accession of Antiochus Epiphanes to the throne
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 175), and goes down to the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 161.</p>

<p>The book opens, as pointed out in the previous section,
with a preface by the epitomist in which he explains the
method he has adopted in the abridged history that is to
follow (ii. 19-32). In iii. 1-39 an account is given of how
Heliodorus, the king’s chancellor, was sent to seize the
treasure in the Temple, but failed owing to the miraculous
appearance of a “terrible rider,” accompanied by two young
men, “beautiful in their glory and splendid in their apparel,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
by whom Heliodorus was scourged. He returns, discomfited,
to the king; but testifies to all men “the works
of the most supreme God which he had seen with his own
eyes.” In the section which then follows (iii. 40-iv. 50)
the writer describes the sordid intrigues on the part of
aspirants to the high-priesthood at this time.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> With chapter
v. commences the history of the Maccabæan struggle which
began with the profanation of the Temple and the attempt
on the part of Antiochus Epiphanes to hellenize the Jews
by force; this, together with some account of the persecution
which followed, and especially the story of how seven
brothers and their mother were martyred, is told in v. i-vii.
42. The rest of the book deals with the details of the Maccabæan
struggle: the rising-up of Judas Maccabæus and
his first successes (viii. 1-36); an account of the death of
Antiochus Epiphanes (ix. 1-29); the recapture of Jerusalem
and the dedication of the Temple (x. 1-8); further successes
of Judas Maccabæus and especially the capture of Gazara,
when the Jews were aided by five men from heaven, splendidly
arrayed and sitting on horses with golden bridles
(x. 9-38); the defeat of Lysias, and a patched-up peace
(xi. 1-38); more fighting, after which Lysias is again forced
to make terms of peace (xii. i-xiii. 26); three years’ peace,
followed by an attack on the part of Nicanor which results
in his defeat and death (xiv. i-xv. 36). The book then
closes with a short and somewhat <i lang="fr">naïve</i> epilogue by the
epitomist (xv. 37-39).</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_III">III. <span class="smcap">Comparison between 1 and 2 Maccabees</span></h4>

<p>That the writers of these two books cannot have used the
same sources becomes very obvious when one compares
together the large portions of each which run parallel.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
In fact, the first thing that strikes one in comparing the two
is the difference in aim of the compilers and the contrast
there is in their manner of presentation. The writer of
1 Maccabees is, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> a sober and reliable
historian, mostly accurate, who presents his facts without
bias in a businesslike, impartial way, and therefore inspires
confidence. The epitomist of 2 Maccabees, on the other
hand, has utilized his sources for a different purpose; his
aim is not so much to write history as to glorify the Jews,
so he chooses episodes which will serve this purpose. Martyrdoms
are described, sometimes with painful realism, to show
the constancy of the Jews in suffering when they are called
upon to do this for their faith. The writer desires, moreover,
to inculcate certain religious truths, chief among which is
God’s solicitude for His people; so that he loves to dwell
upon the marvellous appearances of heavenly messengers sent
by God to succour His people at critical moments. How
far these accounts are due to Jason and how far to the epitomist
is a difficult question; but if, as there is reason to believe,
Jason’s work was compiled not long after the events they
record, there is little time for that growth of the miraculous
which so often accompanies stories when they are repeated
and handed down, and which is characteristic of much that
is recorded in 2 Maccabees. In this case, a good deal of the
embellishment with which our book abounds, in contrast with
1 Maccabees, would have to be put down to the imagination
of the epitomist. And there are one or two facts which
tend to support this supposition; he says in his prefatory
remarks that his intention is only to give an outline of the
events he is about to chronicle, “leaving to the historian
the exact handling of every particular,” and that he has no
intention of “filling in the outlines of our abridgement”;
but, as a matter of fact, he does on certain occasions give
minute details, and in most cases these are found in passages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
which illustrate the special aims which he has in view. Again,
he confesses that he writes with a view to attracting; it
will be no injustice to him to say that his idea of attractiveness
consists in recording what is sensational. In both
these cases it is, of course, quite possible that the material
in all its details comes from Jason—for the epitomist is not
afraid of contradicting himself—but when one remembers
the aim of the latter the possibility of the other alternative
must be conceded, the more so in that the epitomist does,
on the face of it, give us his own ideas at times. Here is
a good example:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>I beseech, therefore, those that read this book, that they be not
discouraged at such calamities [he has been describing a peculiarly
cruel case of martyrdom], but to reflect that these punishments were
not for the destruction but for the chastening of our race. For,
indeed, that those who act impiously be not let alone for any length
of time, but suffer retribution immediately, is a sign of great kindness.
For in the case of the other nations the Sovereign Lord doth with
long-suffering forbear, until that He punish them when they have
attained to the full measure of their sins. But in our case He hath
determined otherwise that His vengeance may not fall on us afterwards
when our sins have reached their height. Wherefore He
never withdraweth His mercy from us; yet though He chasteneth
His own people with calamity, yet doth He not forsake them.
Howbeit, let what hath been said be a reminder to ourselves. And
after these few words we must come back to our narrative (vi. 12-17).</p>
</div>

<p>It should also be remarked that the doctrine of retribution
here put forth, and the teaching on prayers for the dead
(xii. 43, 45), and on the intercession of the departed saints
(xv. 11-16), and the doctrine of the resurrection of the
body (vii. 11, 22, 23, xiv. 46), are all doctrines which belong
more specifically to a somewhat later time than Jason’s
history. For these reasons we are justified in believing that
a not inconsiderable amount of matter in our book must be
assigned to the epitomist.</p>

<p>But the superiority of 1 Maccabees is equally evident on
comparing with it those many passages of 2 Maccabees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
forming of course the bulk of this book, in which the same
events are recorded in each book. To go in to the details of
these would be out of place here, recourse must be had to the
commentaries for the study of the subject; but one good
example may be referred to; if one compares 1 Maccabees
v. 1-68 with the parallel account of the events given in 2
Maccabees x. 14-38, xii. 10-45, <ins class="corr" id="tn-485" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'one is unevitably'">
one is inevitably</ins> led to the
conclusion that the orderly narrative of 1 Maccabees contrasted
with the confused records of 2 Maccabees stamps the
former as the more reliable; and the same applies to a number
of other instances. This conviction is strengthened when one
comes across obvious mistakes in 2 Maccabees; one example
may be given: in 2 Maccabees x. 37 it is said that “they slew
Timotheus who was hidden in a cistern,” yet later, in chapter
xii., a good deal is recorded about Timotheus’ activity against
the Jews. And lastly, the question of the inferiority of 2
Maccabees is placed beyond further doubt<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> by the historical
errors of an obvious character found in it. Here again we
must refer our readers to the commentaries for details, while
merely pointing to a few instances, viz. ix. 5-29; compare
v. 22, ix. 29 with what is said in xiii. 23; and cp. xiii. 22
with 1 Maccabees vi. 49, 50 and Josephus, <cite>Antiq.</cite>, XII, ix.
5; xi. 1-15; cp. xiv. 1 ff. with 1 Maccabees vii. 1 ff.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Historical Value of 2 Maccabees</span></h4>

<p>But in spite of what has been said it is not to be supposed
that 2 Maccabees is wholly without historical value. If, as
is probably the case, the sources upon which it depends were
themselves compiled, in the main, from the accounts of eye-witnesses
of the events chronicled, this fact in itself counts
for something; for example, the following description is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span>
without interest and certainly reads as though told by one
who was present: “But at dawn on the five and twentieth
day some young men belonging to the Maccabæan army,
burning with indignation because of these blasphemies,
stormed the wall like men, and furious with passion hewed
down everyone whom they met. Others in the meantime
had followed them up by an encircling movement and had
set fire to the towers, thus kindling fires and burning the
blasphemers alive, while yet others burst open the gates
and let in the rest of the band, and thus took possession of
the city. And they slew Timotheus who was hidden in a
cistern, and his brother Chæreas, and Apollophanes” (x.
35-37). Or, again, the graphic details given of the episode
described in xii. 35 must evidently have come originally
from one who had witnessed it: “But a certain Dositheus,
belonging to the Tubieni,<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> a horseman and vigorous,
took hold of Gorgias and, seizing his cloke, dragged him
along by main force, intending to take the accursed man alive;
but one of the Thracian horsemen bore down upon him
and disabled his shoulder, so Gorgias escaped to Marisa.”
These and other passages of a similar character containing
vivid touches, such as are not likely to have been supplied
excepting by eye-witnesses, have a distinct value of their
own. A point of importance in this connection is the fact
that for some five or six years preceding the accession to the
throne of Antiochus Epiphanes 2 Maccabees is the only
existing source, see iii. i-iv. 6; this passage contains a
number of details, the historical reliability of which there
is no reason to doubt. The book also gives a good deal of
information supplementary to that of 1 Maccabees for the
subsequent period of about ten years (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 176-<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 166),
cp. 2 Maccabees iv. 7-vii. 41 with 1 Maccabees i. 10-64.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span></p>

<p>The final period treated of (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 166-161) also supplements
1 Maccabees in many particulars and is not without
value.</p>

<p>While upon the whole, therefore, the historical worth of
our book is not to be rated very highly, it can be of real use
in supplementing what is recorded in 1 Maccabees, though
it must be used with caution and discrimination.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Purpose of the Book</span></h4>

<p>In reading our book it very soon becomes evident that it
was written with the special purpose of emphasizing some
religious truths, and this with the object of upholding orthodox
Judaism and worship. The predominating religious
bent comes out clearly on reading such a passage as vi. 12-17,
already quoted (see also ii. 19, 20, xii. 43-45), and on noticing
how everything that has to do with religion is extolled.
Thus, the references to the Temple are numerous, as well
as those to the altar, e.g., x. 1-3: “And Maccabæus and
they that were with him, the Lord leading them on, recovered
the temple and the city.... And having cleansed
the sanctuary they made another altar of sacrifice ...”; cp.
further, ii. 22, iii. 12, v. 15, etc.; again in xiii. 14 the people
are exhorted “to contend nobly even unto death for laws,
temple, city, country ...”; in like manner are mentioned
the sabbaths (vi. 11, viii. 26, xii. 38), the feasts of Tabernacles
(x. 6 f.), Pentecost (xii. 31), Dedication (i. 9, 18, ii.
16, x. 5-8), Purim (xv. 36), and the feast in celebration of
the death of Nicanor (xv. 36). Regarding this latter feast
and the feast of Dedication Torrey says: “Many scholars
since Ewald have remarked the prominence given in the
plan of the book not only to the feast celebrating the death
of Nicanor, with the institution of which the whole history
comes to an end, but also to the feast of the re-dedication
of the temple, the description of which closes the first half
of the book, the passage x. 1-8 apparently being removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
for this purpose from its proper place. The account of the
institution of the Nicanor feast would have been a most
natural point for Jason to bring his book to a close, in
any case. This would have been just the kind of ending
best suited to his general purpose.... The author’s aim
not being that of a historian, there was no need for him to
go on and narrate the death of Judas; his purpose was
fully accomplished without that. The transposition of x.
1-8, however, is probably to be attributed to the epitomist
who saw how the plan of the book could thus be made
subservient to his more definite aim, increased significance
being thereby given both to the Nicanor feast and to the
feast of the Dedication. These were <em>the two Maccabæan
feasts</em>, by the observance of which the Jews of the Diaspora
could share, as in no other outward way, in the national
glory of that struggle.”<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>This emphasizing of the national unity on the basis of
religion and worship was, we may well believe, in the
author’s mind as well as in that of the epitomist. His
denunciation of those who are unfaithful to the national
religion (cp. iv. 13-17, xii. 39-42) only emphasizes this still
further.</p>

<p>Another feature in the religious attitude very prominent
in this book is the stress laid upon divine interposition; and
here it is noticeable that both the direct intervening of
God is contemplated as well as the accomplishment of His
purposes by intermediary agents. As illustrative of the
former we may refer to ix. 5 where it is said in reference to
Antiochus Epiphanes that “the All-seeing Lord, the God
of Israel, smote him with a fatal and invisible stroke”;
again in xii. 28: “But calling upon the Sovereign Who with
might breaketh in pieces the strength of His enemies, they
got the city into their hands ...”; cp. further x. 1, xi. 13,
xii. 11, xiii. 15. On the other hand, there are some striking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
instances of a belief in intermediate agencies, the most noteworthy
being that of the “terrible rider” accompanied by
two young men who opposed Heliodorus and prevented
him from despoiling the Temple treasury (iii. 22-30); but
there are other examples in the book, see x. 29-31, xi. 6-11.</p>

<p>Lastly, brief mention must be made of the advanced
teaching on the resurrection which was evidently one of the
truths which was coming to be more and more definitely
and emphatically taught as a tenet of orthodox Judaism in
the second half of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; the important
passages on this teaching are worth quoting, for there is
no other pre-Christian Jewish book which puts forth the
doctrine of the resurrection of the body more definitely. In
vii. 9 one of the martyrs addresses his persecutor thus:
“Thou miscreant, thou dost send us away out of this present
life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have
died for His laws, unto an eternal renewal of life.” Another
martyr, after having had his limbs cut off, is made to say:
“From heaven I possess these; but for His law’s sake I
count them as nothing, and from Him I hope to receive them
back again” (vii. 11). And yet a third martyr says: “It
is good for them that die at the hands of men to look for the
hopes of God that we shall be raised up again by Him. But
thou,” he says to his tormentor, “thou shalt have no resurrection
to life” (vii. 14). In xii. 43-45 not only is this
doctrine taught, but its truth is substantiated by Judas’
action in offering sacrifices and prayers for the dead:</p>

<p>“And he made a collection, man by man, to the sum of
two thousand drachmas of silver; and he sent this to Jerusalem
for a sin-offering, acting therein well and honourably,
for he was bearing in mind the resurrection. For if he were
not expecting that the fallen would rise again, it would have
been superfluous and senseless to pray for the dead. And if
in doing this he was looking for the splendour of the gracious
reward which is laid up for them that have fallen asleep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
in godliness, holy and pious was the thought. Wherefore
he made a propitiation for them that had died that they
might be released from their sin” (cp. xiv. 46).</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_VI">VI. <span class="smcap">The Integrity of the Book</span></h4>

<p>There is one portion of our book which neither belonged
to Jason’s history nor yet to the epitomist, viz. i.-ii. 18.
This comprises two letters which must be considered
separately.</p>

<p><em>The first letter</em>, i. 1-9. This purports to have been written
by the Jews of Jerusalem to their brethren throughout
Egypt exhorting them to observe the feast of the Dedication.
It begins with a greeting and a prayer that God may incline
the hearts of the readers to serve Him faithfully and keep
His Law. Then follows the date at which the letter was
written, i.e. <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 143, after which the real object of the letter
finds expression; the readers are reminded of the original
institution of the feast of Dedication, namely after the
Temple had been polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes; “and
we offered sacrifice and meal-offering, and we lighted the
lamps [this was the central ceremony of the celebration],
and we set forth the shewbread”; after which the letter
closes with the words: “And now see that ye keep the days
of the feast of tabernacles of the month Chislev.” To understand
these final words one must read x. 5-8: “Now on the
same day that the sanctuary had been profaned by aliens,
upon that very day did the cleansing of the sanctuary take
place, even on the twenty-fifth day of the same month,
which is Chislev. And they kept eight days with gladness
in the manner of the feast of tabernacles, remembering how
that, not long before, during the feast of tabernacles they
had been wandering like wild beasts in mountains and caves.
Therefore bearing wands wreathed with leaves, and fair
boughs and palms, they offered up hymns of thanksgiving
to Him that had prosperously brought to pass the cleansing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
of His own place. They ordained also with a public order
and decree, for all the nation of the Jews, that they should
keep these ten<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> days every year.” So that this new feast
was observed as something parallel, in its joyfulness, to the
feast of Tabernacles (<em>Succôth</em>) which was also an eight-day
feast, but observed in the month Tishri (= October).<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The interpretation of this letter given above regards the
date mentioned in i. 10<i>a</i> as belonging to the second letter<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>;
there are objections to this, but it seems the best way of
dealing with what is in any case a difficult point.</p>

<p>We see no reason why this letter should not be the fragment
of a genuine record, added by the epitomist himself.</p>

<p><em>The second letter</em>, i. 10-11. 18. The date prefixed to this
letter is 188 of the Seleucid era, i.e. <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 124. Like the
former letter this also purports to have been written by the
Jews<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> of Jerusalem to their brethren in Egypt for the purpose
of urging them to keep the feast of the Dedication;
but it has the special object “of demonstrating at length its
historical significance, indicating at the same time in other
ways the analogy between the Maccabæan period and the
other principal epochs of the nation’s life.”<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> The Antiochus
whose death is described in i. 13-17 is not Epiphanes,
concerning whose death an entirely different account is
given in ix. 1-29,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> but far more probably, as Torrey has
shown, Antiochus VII Sidetes.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> This, like the first letter,
may be regarded as having been prefixed by the epitomist
from some genuine record; at any rate, the arguments
against this view are not strong enough to exclude the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
of its being correct. The extraordinary stories which
the letter contains undoubtedly constitute a difficulty in
regarding it as genuine (i. 20-22, 31-34, ii. 1-12), but it is
quite possible to regard these as Midrashic comments on
Old Testament texts written for the purpose of showing
that the institution of the feast of the Dedication was the
logical outcome of Old Testament precedent and teaching.
Torrey has rightly pointed out that “one feature of the
writer’s demonstration deserves especial notice, namely the
extent to which it is based on the conception of the Dedication
as a <em>restoration of the sacred fire</em> to the altar and the
temple.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Evidently at that time this idea had a most
prominent place (perhaps the central place) in current
Jewish thought regarding the origin and meaning of this
feast.”<a id="FNanchor_507a" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> It is perhaps this idea which is reflected in the
name of the feast given by Josephus, “the feast of lights,”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
and by its usual designation in the Talmud, “the Feast of
Illumination,” though in the first instance no doubt these
names had reference to the lamps lighted on each day of the
feast, eight on the first day, and one less on each succeeding
day. However this may be, if the stories referred to were
originally Midrashic comments there is no reason why they
should not have been incorporated in a letter from Jews to
Jews.</p>

<p>Both these letters were originally written either in Hebrew
or Aramaic; and if, as we do not see sufficient reason to
doubt, the epitomist prefixed them to his book, his doing
so, considering that they emphasize the need of carrying out
a religious ceremony, would have been a natural proceeding
on his part when one remembers the leading characteristic
of his book as pointed out above.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, these two letters do not belong to the
book they may reasonably be regarded as having been prefixed
by the epitomist. Whether there are other portions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
in the body of the book which the epitomist got from
sources other than Jason’s history is a difficult question to
which it does not seem possible to give a definite answer.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_VII">VII. <span class="smcap">The Date and Original Language of the Book</span></h4>

<p>There is scarcely anything in the book itself which gives
us any indication as to when it was written, the advanced
doctrine of the future life (in a non-apocalyptic book) and
the tendency to ascribe divine activity among men to intermediate
agencies alone suggesting a comparatively late date.
On the other hand, it is practically certain that Philo was
acquainted with the book, for in his work <cite lang="la">Quod omnis
probus liber</cite> (Mangey, ii. 45<i>a</i>) a description is given of the
way in which in time past the godly have suffered at the
hands of persecutors, which forcibly recalls the words in
2 Maccabees concerning Antiochus Epiphanes.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Nothing
more specific as to date can, therefore, be given beyond
saying that it was probably written shortly before the beginning
of the Christian era.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the book which points to its being a
translation; it was manifestly written in Greek (with the
exception, of course, of the two prefixed letters) as already
Jerome saw.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> “The style is extremely uneven; at times
it is elaborately ornate (iii. 15-39, v. 20, vi. 12-16, 23-28,
vii., etc.); and again, it is so rude and broken up as to seem
more like notes for an epitome than a finished composition
(viii. 19-26).”<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> In all probability the book was written in
Alexandria.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHX_VIII">VIII. <span class="smcap">The Influence of the Book on New Testament
Writers</span></h4>

<p>In only one instance can the influence of our book be
seen directly in the New Testament, namely in Hebrews<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
xi. 35 ff., where we read: “Women received their dead by
a resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting
their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection;
and others had trial of mockings and scourgings....”
On comparing with this the whole of 2 Maccabees vi., vii.
one cannot fail to see that the descriptions there given
influenced the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews here;
we may quote, for example, vi. 19 where, in speaking of
the martyrdom of Eleazar, it is said: “But he, welcoming
death with renown rather than life with pollution, advanced
of his own accord to the instrument of torture ...” (cp. also
verse 28). Again, in vii. 23 the mother of the seven martyred
sons says: “Therefore the Creator of the World, Who
fashioned the generation<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
of man and devised the generation<a id="FNanchor_512a" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
of all things, in mercy giveth back to you again your spirit and
your life”; and in verse 29 she says: “Fear not this butcher,
but, proving thyself worthy of thy brethren, accept thy death,
that in the mercy of God I may receive thee again with thy
brethren” (cp. vii. 1, 7, 9, 14). In Hebrews xi. 38, once
more, the words “wandering in deserts and mountains and
caves, and in the holes of the earth,” are in part repeated from
2 Maccabees x. 6: “They were wandering in mountains and
in caves after the manner of wild beasts.” In all these
passages the similarity of the Greek words is in each case
very striking.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHXI_I">I. <span class="smcap">Short Account of the Book, and its Contents</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">This short pseudepigraph is placed in the Septuagint
after the Book of Jeremiah, and before Lamentations,
owing to which it is quoted sometimes by the Church Fathers
as though it were part of that book.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> In some of the Greek
manuscripts the Epistle of Jeremiah follows Baruch without
a break; in the Vulgate, and, following it, the English
Versions, it is marked as chapter vi. of Baruch. Swete says
that “Baruch and the Epistle occur in lists which rigorously
exclude the non-canonical books.”<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> We shall consider
the Epistle separately. There was a considerable literature
which arose and circulated both before and after the beginning
of the Christian era<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>; our book belongs to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span>
literature. It purports to have been written by Baruch,
the friend of Jeremiah, in Babylon during the Captivity;
and after it had been read there “in the hearing of Jechonias
the son of Joakim, king of Judah, and in the hearing of all
the people” (i. 3, 4), it was sent to Jerusalem to be read
there (i. 14); with it was also sent a collection of money
to the high-priest Joakim for the purpose of defraying the
expenses of sacrifices (i. 6-10); the people in Jerusalem
are also asked to pray for Nabuchodonosor, king of
Babylon, and for his son, Baltasar, as well as for the exiles
(i. 11-13). This forms the introduction to the book. Then
follows what purports to be the Book of Baruch itself and
this consists of two parts:</p>

<p>i. 15-ii. 12: this, which fully bears out the description
given of it in i. 14 as a book of confession, begins with an
ascription of righteousness to God, after which follows a
confession of sin; the past history of the nation is recalled
to show that in spite of God’s mercy the people were disobedient
to Him and forsook Him; for this reason they are
justly suffering for their sins in that they are in subjection
to the nations round about them.</p>

<p>ii. 13-iii. 8: a prayer to God for mercy forms the content
of this section; but it falls into three divisions; first, a
prayer in the real sense of the word (ii. 13-19); then, an
historical survey which is largely based on Old Testament
passages, especially from the Books of Daniel, Jeremiah
and Deuteronomy (ii. 20-35); and, lastly, another prayer
combined with confession (iii. 1-8).</p>

<p>So far the book is written in prose, the remainder is in
poetry, and consists of two quite independent pieces:</p>

<p>iii. 9-iv. 4: this is a fragment of the Wisdom Literature
type; it tells of the reason why Israel is exiled in the land
of their enemies, namely because they have forsaken “the
fountain of Wisdom”; the people are, therefore bidden to
find out where Wisdom is (iii. 14); the mighty rulers of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
earth, the wealthy, the skilled—these have not known where
Wisdom is to be found (iii. 15-21), nor has it been attained
by those of Canaan or Teman (iii. 22, 23); the giants of old
knew not Wisdom, they perished in their foolishness (iii.
24-28); no one has gone up to heaven to fetch her, nor gone
over the sea to find her, because they do not know her paths
(iii. 29-31); only He that knows all things knows Wisdom,
and He Who has found out all the ways of knowledge has
given Wisdom to Israel, and this Wisdom is the Law that
endures for ever (iii. 32-iv. 1); therefore Israel is exhorted
to make use of his possession (iv. 2-4).</p>

<p>iv. 5-v. 9: this piece is strongly reminiscent of the second
half of Isaiah; it consists of two parts, the first one being
an ode of comfort spoken by Jerusalem, personified as a
mother, to her children in captivity (iv. 5-35); the second
is an ode of comfort spoken to Jerusalem who is bidden to
rejoice, for her children are to be led back to her from their
captivity (iv. 36-v. 9).</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXI_II">II. <span class="smcap">Examination of the Component Parts of the Book</span></h4>

<p>It will thus be seen that the book consists of three independent
documents: i.-iii. 8, iii. 9-iv. 4, iv. 5-v. 9; and these
three differ very much in content. We must now examine
them a little more closely in order to ascertain their nature,
purpose, and approximate date.</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHXI_1">(1) <i>The Book of Confessions</i> (i-iii. 8).</h5>

<p>It is stated in i. 2 that the book was written in the “fifth
year”; presumably by this is meant the fifth year after
the capture of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem was captured
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 597, and again in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 587 (2 Kings xxiv. 12-16;
2 Kings XXV. 9), so that our book is assigned either to
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 592 or <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 582. Both these dates are, however, impossible,
for two indications in the book show clearly that
the writer utilized the Book of Daniel (early in the
Maccabæan era). Thus, the mistake made in Daniel v.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
13, etc., where Belshazzar is regarded as the son of
Nebuchadnezzar,<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> is repeated in our book, i. 11, 12; so
far as is known this mistake does not occur elsewhere, the
natural presumption, therefore, is that the writer of Baruch
got it from Daniel, especially when, in the second place, we
find that both the confession and prayer which make up the
whole section, are based upon Daniel ix. 7-19, of which it is
an elaboration. Further, that the section cannot belong
to the Maccabæan era is sufficiently clear from i. 11, 12,
where the people are recommended to pray for their oppressor
and to acquiesce in his sovereignty over them; such a
recommendation on the part of a Jew during the Maccabæan
era, when the people were fighting not only for their
country and their homes, but for their religion and for the
honour of God, is quite unthinkable. The transference to an
earlier historical period than that at which a writer lived is
a literary device constructed for one of several reasons,
whether for dramatic effect, as in the case of the Book of
Judith, where likewise the reign of Nebuchadnezzar is
chosen; or for reasons of prudence, as probably in the
present case; or because a somewhat parallel set of historical
conditions is offered; whatever the reason may be, the
procedure is not uncommon and need not occasion surprise.
In the present case there are strong grounds for believing
that the actual period at which this section of our book was
written was during the struggle of the Jews against the
Roman power during the years, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 66-70; the reasons for
this conclusion are briefly these: Nebuchadnezzar and his
son were, according to the belief of the writer of our book,
the kings under whom the conquered Jews lived; their
names might well stand, therefore, for Vespasian and his
son Titus. The Jews are bidden to submit to their conquerors
(“Thus saith the Lord, Bow your shoulders to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
serve the king of Babylon, and remain in the land that I
gave unto your fathers,” ii. 21); this accords with what we
know was the attitude of the Pharisees towards their Roman
conquerors, for they did their best to quiet the people and
get them to submit to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Again, the sufferings of the
Jews during the war with Rome, described by Josephus,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
seem to be indubitably referred to in ii. 2, where reference
is made to “great plagues, such as never happened under the
whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem”; in ii. 3,
where it is said that every man ate the flesh of his own son
and of his own daughter; and in ii. 24, 25, where it is said
that “the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers
are taken out of their places; and, lo, they are cast out to
the heat by day, and to the frost by night; and they died in
great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.” It
is also said in i. 2 that Jerusalem was burnt with fire.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>An argument against this late date is that in ii. 17 we have
a conception of the future life which is the normal Old Testament
belief on the subject, viz.: “For the dead that are in the
grave, whose breath is taken from their bodies, will give unto
the Lord neither glory nor righteousness”; it is difficult to
explain how such a conception can have found expression
at the date postulated above, unless we suppose that we
have in ii. 17-19 an interpolation by one of the Sadducæan
party; it is certainly striking that in verse 19 there is a
repudiation of the doctrine of the merits of the fathers, which
plays so large a part in the later Jewish theology; the
verse runs: “For we do not present our supplication before
Thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers,
and of our kings”; if in these last words there is an implicit
reference to David the passage would be the more strikingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span>
Sadducæan. That the book as a whole, however, can be Sadducæan
is out of the question; if for no other reason on account
of the penitential spirit contained in it which is quite un-Sadducæan;
but that an interpolator has added these verses
in the interests of his own school of thought is by no means
an impossible explanation of the difficulty (but see below).<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>The period to which reference is intended in the book,
namely the war with Rome, being <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 66-70, the fifth year
after the destruction of Jerusalem, mentioned in i. 2, will
give us the precise date of this portion of our book, viz.
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 74 or 75.</p>

<p>But while the actual date of this portion of the book
may thus be regarded as fixed, it is necessary to point out
that there are cogent reasons for believing that the writer
has made use of earlier material. The fact is that the whole
piece i. 15-iii. 8 reads remarkably like an extract of a liturgical
character; it has all the leading notes which we find
so elaborated in the modern Jewish Liturgy, a Liturgy the
essential elements of which go back to pre-Christian times.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
Thus, in the passage under consideration the three outstanding
notes are: Praise, Confession of sin (disobedience in not
observing the divine commandments), and Prayer for
forgiveness (i.e. the turning away of God’s wrath). These
all represent what have become technical liturgical terms,
viz. <em>Berakah</em> (“Praise,” lit. “Blessing”), <em>Widdui</em> (“Confession”),
<em>Selichah</em> (“Forgiveness”). When one studies
the modern Jewish Liturgy one sees that it is just in its
oldest portions that these three elements are so prominent;
for example, the daily Morning Prayer has not only its
special psalm of Praise for each day, but contains a large
number of <em>Berakôth</em> (“Blessings”) which precede this;
while in the great <em>Amidah</em><a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> prayer, which forms one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
central parts of the service, the prominent elements are
Confession of sin and Prayer for forgiveness. It will be
instructive to illustrate this by putting in parallel columns
a few quotations from Baruch and the <em>Amidah</em>:</p>

    <div class="textcoly">

<p><span class="pad4"><i>Baruch</i></span></p>

<p>To the Lord our God belongeth
righteousness (i. 15) ...
we have sinned before the Lord,
and disobeyed Him, and have
not hearkened unto the voice of
the Lord our God, to walk in the
commandments of the Lord that He
hath set before us (ii. 17, 18).
... Let thy wrath turn from
us; for we are but a few left
among the heathen, where Thou
hast scattered us. Hear our
prayer, O Lord, and our petition,
and deliver us for Thine
own sake.... O Lord, look
down from Thine holy house, and
consider us; incline Thine ear,
O Lord, and hear ... (ii. 13-17).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="textcoly">

<p><span class="pad4"><i>Amidah</i></span></p>

<p>Blessed art Thou, O Lord our
God, and God of our fathers ...
the great, mighty and reverend
God, the most high God, Who
bestowest loving-kindnesses,
and possessest all things....
Cause us to return, O our Father,
unto Thy Law; draw us near,
O our King, unto Thy service,
and bring us back in perfect
repentance unto Thy presence.
Blessed art Thou, O Lord,
Who delightest in repentance.
Forgive us, O our Father, for we
have sinned; pardon us, O our
King, for we have transgressed;
for Thou dost pardon and forgive.
... Look upon our affliction
and plead our cause,
and redeem us speedily for Thy
name’s sake.... Sound the great
horn for our freedom; lift up
the ensign to gather our exiles,
and gather us from the four
corners of the earth.</p>
    </div>

<p>A detailed consideration of the two shows many more
points of contact between them and proves a very close
relationship; but this is not the place to go into great
detail. Two other points must, however, be touched upon.
We suggested above that the passage ii. 17-19 might be an
interpolation in the interests of Sadducæan teaching, namely
to emphasize the old traditional belief regarding the departed,
and to repudiate the doctrine of the merits of the
fathers; but the possibility (perhaps even the probability)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
must be recognized of verse 17 having been original, and
having first been altered in accordance with the developed
Pharisaic teaching, and then having finally been restored
to its original form by a Sadducee. Verse 19, on the other
hand, would then have to be regarded as a Pharisaic interpolation
altered by the Sadducee, because there would be
no point in the repudiation of the doctrine of the merits
of the fathers unless the expression of this un-Sadducæan
tenet had stood there first; but it is not likely to have stood
in the original form of the section because the doctrine is a
late one. It is especially interesting and significant that
the doctrines contained in these two verses respectively
should appear in close proximity in the <em>Amidah</em>; let us place
the two in parallel columns again:</p>

    <div class="textcoly">

<p><span class="pad4"><i>Baruch</i></span></p>

<p>For the dead that are in the
grave, whose breath is taken
from their bodies, will give unto
the Lord neither glory nor
righteousness (ii. 17).</p>

<p>For we do not present our
supplication before Thee, O
Lord our God, for the righteous-
ness of our fathers, and of our
kings (ii. 19).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="textcoly">

<p><span class="pad4"><i>Amidah</i></span></p>

<p>Thou, O Lord, art mighty
for ever, Thou quickenest the
dead, Thou art mighty to save....
Yea, faithful art Thou to
quicken the dead. Blessed art
Thou O Lord, Who quickenest
the dead.</p>

<p>Blessed art Thou, O Lord
our God ... Who rememberest
the pious deeds of the
patriarchs....<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>
    </div>

<p>The contrast here presented is the more striking on account
of the essential similarity of the two pieces in other respects.</p>

<p>The second point which further supports our contention
that this section is liturgical in character is that it contains
references to the deliverance from Egypt, an invariable
element in all forms of the Jewish Liturgy; this occurs three
times in the Baruch section; and in the modern Jewish
Liturgy it is found, among other places, in the “Benedictions”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
following the <em>Shema</em>,<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> which immediately precedes the
<em>Amidah</em>. “From Jeremiah xxiii. 7 it seems probable that
reference to the deliverance from Egypt in the public services
goes back to the time of the first Temple.”<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>From what has been said, therefore, the supposition seems
justified that the section i. 15-iii. 8 is an extract from the
Temple Liturgy which has been enlarged by interjected
clauses and adapted to the special circumstances of the time,
viz. <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 74 or 75.</p>


<h5 id="PII_CHXI_2">(2) <i>A Sage’s Words of Encouragement</i> (iii. 9-iv. 4).</h5>

<p>The entirely different style of writing of both this and the
concluding piece from that of the one which we have just
considered is of itself sufficient to show that there is a difference
of authorship. There is no reference to calamity as in
the earlier piece; here it is said of the Israelites that they
have “waxen old in a strange country” (iii. 10). The
contrast between the mental disquietude of i. 15-iii. 8 and
the calm of this section is very marked. The assumed
condition of the nation, however, is that of the former
section, the nation is in the land of exile. The writer is an
imitator of the ancient Sage or Wisdom writer; his word of
consolation to the people is that they should learn where
Wisdom is (iii. 14); but this Wisdom is “the Law that endureth
for ever” (iv. 1); he bids his people reserve this for
themselves and not impart it to outsiders; “Give not thy
glory to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee
to a strange nation” (iv. 3). Finally, a spirit of contentment
breathes in the words: “O Israel, happy are we; for
the things that are pleasing to God are made known unto
us” (iv. 4).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504"></a>[504]</span></p>

<p>Now, although the indications of date are not very definite
here, one or two points of guidance do appear: there is peace,
and the people have been settled for a good while in their
exile; therefore the section belongs to a period some time
after the destruction of Jerusalem. The writer is a student
of the Law, and he writes on Wisdom, and rejoices in the
knowledge of the things that are pleasing unto God, and
exhorts others to do the same. All these things lead one to
suggest that the scene is one of those academies in Babylonia,
such as that at Nehardea, which received a considerable
influx of Jews from Palestine after the great calamity of
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70; in these they studied in peace and reared up
students of the Law. This section (iii. 9-iv. 4), therefore,
may quite possibly have been written under these conditions
at the commencement of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> or even
later, though it must have been written not later than about
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 150 or thereabouts as the book is quoted by Athenagoras
and Irenæus.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Both the sections so far considered were probably written
in Hebrew, or in the case of the second in Aramaic; Marshall
has given good grounds for the latter contention.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>


<h5 id="PII_CHXI_3">(3) <i>A Message of Good Cheer</i> (iv. 5-v. 9).</h5>

<p>This section consists of two divisions, but both have the
same object in view and both are in all probability by the
same author. The object of them is to cheer the Jewish
people who are still pictorially represented as being in
captivity (iv. 24). The thought and diction of the first
division (iv. 5-35) are largely based on those of the Old
Testament; Jerusalem is represented as the mother of the
nation who tells her children why they are suffering, namely
through their own folly; she does not wish to plunge them
into despair by reminding them of this, but only to witness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
to the facts for her children’s good; she has given herself
to prayer, and therefore is convinced that a new era will
soon dawn for them. The four times reiterated “Be of
good cheer” (iv. 5, 21, 27, 30) distinctly shows the purpose
of the poem.</p>

<p>The last division (iv. 36-v. 9) is a message of comfort to
Jerusalem herself put into the mouth of God; she is bidden
to rejoice because her children are about to return “from
the east to the west at the word of the Holy One” (iv. 37).
The similarity between this piece and the eleventh of the
Psalms of Solomon is striking,<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> so much so that it is worth
while putting the parallel passages in juxtaposition:</p>

<p>They come gathered together
from the east to the west,</p>

<p>Rejoicing in the glory of God

<p>The Psalms of Solomon belong, as we have seen,<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> to about
the middle of the last century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and on the supposition
that the Baruch passage is dependent on the Psalm (Ryle
and James),<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> a <i lang="la">terminus a quo</i> is given for the date of the former.
The indications in the Baruch passage, however, point
to a much later date, and we see no reason to regard the date
of this piece as different from that of the section iii. 9-iv. 4,
the background of each is a peaceful present and a calm
future; the beginning of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> may be
assigned as approximately the date of this section too.</p>

<p>The original language of the whole of iv. 5-v. 9 is recognized
by most scholars as having been Greek from the
beginning.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXI_JER"><span class="smcap">The Epistle of Jeremiah</span></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<span class="smcap">Literature.</span>—Gifford, in Wace, II, pp. 287-303; Rothstein, in
Kautzsch, I, pp. 226-229; Ball, in Charles, I, pp. 596-611.]</p>
</div>

<p>In the Vulgate this Epistle appears as the sixth chapter
of Baruch; but in the Septuagint it is treated as a separate
book and comes after Lamentations with the inscription
“Letter of Jeremy,” and a title<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> which runs: “Copy of a
letter which Jeremiah sent to those who were about to be
led captives by the king of the Babylonians, to give them a
message, as it had been commanded him by God.”</p>

<p>It has been thought by some that this letter was suggested
by the letter referred to in Jeremiah xxix. 1,<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> which was sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507"></a>[507]</span>
“from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity,
and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the
people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive
from Jerusalem to Babylon”; but this seems unlikely because
the contents of the letter here spoken of are given in
verses 4 ff. of the same chapter. The letter before us is a not
very skilfully composed polemic against idolatry based to a
large extent upon Jeremiah x. 1-16, Psalm cxv. 4-8, and
Isaiah xlix. 9-19; it is also reminiscent of such passages
as Wisdom xiii. 10-19, xv. 13-17.</p>

<p>That the writer is seeking to check a real danger, namely
that of many of the Dispersion Jews falling into idolatry,
seems certain from the obvious earnestness with which he
writes; and this, indirect as it is, seems to be the only
indication of the date of the writing. For if this danger was
real it implies that the time was one of peace for the Jews.
We know from 2 Maccabees what was the result of seeking
to force an alien religion upon them, but from this letter it
is clear that the real danger lay in the allurement which the
idol-worship had for many of the Jews, and that their choice
was free. In times of stress loyalty to their religious beliefs
and customs was always characteristic of the Jews, while
when peace and quietude and prosperity was enjoyed by
them laxity in religious matters arose. The implication,
therefore, is that this letter was written at a time when the
Jews were in the enjoyment both of religious liberty and
peaceful surroundings. Another implication is that this
period of quiet had lasted some time; the danger of which
the letter bears witness would have taken some time to
develop. Then further, there is no reference to the great
calamity of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70, which affected the Dispersion Jews very
deeply from a religious point of view, and which would
therefore have been referred to, one may presume, had the
letter been written some time soon after this catastrophe.
The possibility of its having been written some time before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508"></a>[508]</span>
this must be allowed; Marshall holds, for example, that it
was written during the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>; and there is no
strong argument against this; the present writer prefers
to date it along with the two preceding sections of this book,
though he fully realizes the force of Cheyne’s words that “it
is hardly possible to fix the date exactly, and unsafe even
to say that the epistle was written before 2 Maccabees, the
supposed reference to it in 2 Maccabees iii. 1 ff. being
disputed.”<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The Epistle was, according to the opinion of most scholars,
written in Greek; Ball, with much ingenuity and learning,
seeks to show that it was written in Hebrew; but very
ingenious as many of the instances are which he brings
forward to show that the Greek is a translation of either
the genuine Hebrew or, in other cases, of a corruption in the
Hebrew text, they are by no means always convincing; and
while it may be said that he has shown the possibility of its
having been translated from Hebrew, it can hardly be said
that he has demonstrated the probability of this. The
Hebraisms it contains may well be no more than what are
characteristic of Hellenistic Greek. If it could be proved
that the epistle was written in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 306, as Ball holds, we
should have to give up the idea of a Greek original; but in
this case we should be at a loss to know why it was not
included in the Hebrew Canon.</p>

<h4 id="PII_CHXII_I">I. <span class="smcap">The Title of the Book</span></h4>

<p class="drop-capy">As we shall see, chapters i. ii. xv. xvi. did not originally
belong to our book and are only found in the Latin
Version (the Greek Version is not extant). In the oriental Versions
(Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic, Armenian) the book consists
of only chapters iii.-xiv. In the later Latin MSS. we often
find that: “2 Esdras” = chapters i. ii., “3 Esdras” =
1 Esdras of our Apocrypha, “4 Esdras” = chapters iii.-xiv.,
and “5 Esdras” = chapters xv. xvi. of our book. The
reason, therefore, why the book is often referred to as 2 (4)
Esdras is because what in our Apocrypha is designated “2
Esdras” is in the Vulgate entitled “4 Esdras.”<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510"></a>[510]</span></p>

<p>The book is a pseudepigraph,<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> for although the name of
Esdras (Ezra) occurs in the title, it is obvious, as will be
seen as we proceed, that no part of the book can have been
written by him. For the reason of such false ascriptions of
authorship, see above, <a href="#Page_200">pp. 200</a> ff.</p>

<p>Since the book consists of three independent writings it
will be necessary to consider each separately. We shall
deal with the two later additions first.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXII_II">II. <span class="smcap">Chapters</span> i. ii.</h4>

<p>These chapters, which tell how Ezra received the commission
to declare to the Jews their rejection by God, contains a
curious mixture of Jewish and Christian teaching; i. 4-27
speaks of the deliverance from Egypt and the wanderings
in the wilderness somewhat after the manner of Psalm cvi.
A number of other passages suggest a mental atmosphere
which is Jewish, notably i. 38-40, where it is said that “a
people that come from the east” will have for their leaders
the patriarchs and the prophets; the enumeration which
follows includes the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
those of the twelve minor prophets. In another passage
(i. 8) evil is threatened against the Jews because they have
been disobedient to the Law. On the other hand, these
chapters plainly tell of the rejection of the nation as a whole,
e.g. i. 7: “Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen,
let their names be blotted out of the earth; for they have
despised my covenant”; their heritage is to be given to
others who have now become the people of God: “Tell my
people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which
I would have given unto Israel.” This “kingdom of Jerusalem”
is the “new Jerusalem,” as is clear from the concluding
verses of the whole piece (ii. 42-48): “I, Esdras, saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511"></a>[511]</span>
upon the mount Sion a great multitude, whom I could not
number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. And in
the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature,
taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads
he set crowns.... Then said I unto the angel: ‘What
young man is he that setteth crowns upon them, and giveth
them palms in their hands?’ So he answered and said
unto me: ‘It is the Son of God, Whom they have confessed
in the world.’...” There are, moreover, a number of
passages which are obviously based upon words in the
Gospels, e.g.: “I gathered you together as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings” (i. 30, cp. Matt, xxiii. 37);
“I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have
taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood
I will require [of your hands]” (i. 32, cp. Luke xi. 50, 51);
“Ask, and ye shall receive; pray for few days unto you,
that they may be shortened; the kingdom is already prepared
for you; watch” (ii. 13, cp. Matt. vii. 7, xxiv. 22,
xxv. 13, 32).</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, probable, that these chapters were
written by a Jewish-Christian, who compiled them from various
sources. They are a later addition to the body of the
book, though they contain material which is older. It is
impossible to say when they were added, but there can be no
doubt that they were prefixed before chapters xv. xvi. were
added.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXII_III">III. <span class="smcap">Chapters</span> xv. xvi.</h4>

<p>These chapters form an appendix to the book itself; they
consist of denunciations against Egypt (xv. 5-27), Asia and
Babylon (xv. 28-xvi. 17); while the remaining section,
“The beginning of sorrows” (xvi. 18-78) is a prophecy of
terrors and tribulation which are to come upon the world;
only the Lord’s elect shall ultimately be delivered. The
entire section is written in the style of the Old Testament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512"></a>[512]</span>
prophets, interspersed, however, with words and thoughts
from the New Testament; e.g.: “... he that occupieth
merchandize, (let him be) as he that hath no profit by it;
and he that buildeth, as he that shall not dwell therein;
he that soweth, as if he should not reap; so also he that
pruneth, as he that shall not gather grapes; they that
marry, as they that shall get no children; and they that
marry not, as the widowed” (xvi. 41-44, cp. 1 Cor. vii.
29-31).</p>

<p>The chapters, therefore, partake to some extent of the
character of chapters i. ii., though the denunciation of the
Jewish nation is here quite absent. As to their date,
Thackeray, following Hilgenfeld (<cite lang="de">Messias Judæorum</cite>, p. 208)
says they are placed “about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 268 by most critics; xv.
10-12 refers to the troubles of Alexandria under Gallienus
(260-268), when two-thirds of the population were destroyed
by a plague following upon a famine (Eusebius, <cite>Hist.
Eccles.</cite>, vii. 21, 22). xv. 28-33 refers to the conquests of the
Sassanidæ, especially Sapor I (240-273), who overran Syria,
but was repulsed by Odenathus and Zenobia, the founders
of Palmyra; they, in turn, were defeated by Aurelian.
xv. 33 describes the murder of Odenathus at Emesa (266) by
his cousin Mæonius. xv. 34 ff. refer to the invasion of Asia
Minor by the Goths and Scythians from the north of the
Euxine; Gallienus marched against them, but was recalled
by the revolt of Aureolus. xv. 46 alludes to the association
of Odenathus in the Empire, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 264.”<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXII_IV">IV. <span class="smcap">The Component Parts of Chapters</span> iii.-xiv.</h4>

<p>Before we come to consider the contents of the various
sections composing our book it will be well to enumerate
them, and to discuss shortly the question of their authorship
and date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513"></a>[513]</span></p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The Salathiel Apocalypse</i> (iii.-x.); this is divided into
four Visions:</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
First Vision, iii. 1-v. 20.<br>
Second Vision, v. 21-vi. 34.<br>
Third Vision, vi. 35-ix. 25.<br>
Fourth Vision, ix. 26-x. 59.<br>
</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Eagle Vision</i> (xi.-xii. 39); the passage xii. 40-51
is not part of the Vision.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The Vision of the Man rising from the Sea</i> (xiii.).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>An Ezra Legend</i> (xiv.).</p>

<p>Whether all this matter is to be assigned to one or more
authors is a question concerning which a variety of opinions
are held by scholars. But on two points there is scarcely
room for diversity of view; in the first place, a great deal
that occurs in the book is traditional material which has
been utilized by the writer; this applies more especially to the
eschatological portions; examples will be given when we
come to speak about these parts of the book. The sources
whence the writer of our book took this traditional material
may well have been, in all probability were, written ones;
but the excerpts which were made from such writings have
been so interwoven with what the writer himself composed
that the attempt to indicate precisely how much belongs to
a particular source seems to us somewhat precarious. At any
rate, that the writer did utilize various sources will not be
doubted. Another point upon which there can scarcely be
disagreement is that the final form of the work is due to a
redactor who has brought the component parts of the book
into a more or less connected whole.</p>

<p>Coming now to speak of the date of the book it must be
explained that by this is meant the date at which the author
wrote it. Since he used traditional material much of the
essence of the book goes back to a time long anterior to that
of the writer. Again, the book in its present form, having
been worked over by a redactor, is obviously of a later date<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514"></a>[514]</span>
than that in which it left the original writer’s hands. Furthermore,
the study of the book makes it evident that the different
parts of which it is composed were not all written at the
same time. Even if the whole book (apart from i. ii. xv. xvi.)
is substantially the work of one author, there is no sort of
doubt that he must have written the different parts of it
at different times. Bearing these points in mind we turn
first to the <cite>Salathiel Apocalypse</cite>. In iii. 1 it is said that “in
the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city” (cp. iii. 29),
Salathiel (= Shealtiel) was in Babylon, and “thoughts
came up over his heart for he saw the desolation of Sion.”
The writer looks back and recalls to his mind the terrible
catastrophe which befel his people long ago; it was in the
year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 586 that Jerusalem was destroyed and the nation
was carried into captivity to Babylon. Thirty years after
this Salathiel, living in captivity, contemplated the ruin of
the city and the dire distress of his people. The writer
chooses this episode and writes in the name of Salathiel,
because he sees in it a type of his present experience; now
again the city has been ruined, and he, like Salathiel of
old, contemplates the desolation of his people. Clearly
enough there is but one destruction, after that of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 586,
of Jerusalem which can be meant here, namely that of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
70 by Titus. So that when the writer gives the thirtieth
year after the ruin of the city as that in which he experienced
the visions he is about to describe, the date of this
portion of the book must be set down as not later than <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
100.</p>

<p>Regarding the date of the Eagle Vision, it is generally
agreed to be about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 96; the indications of date in the
Vision are fairly clear; we shall point out what these are
when dealing with this Vision.</p>

<p>The Vision of the Man rising from the Sea contains more
of traditional elements than any other part of the book, so
that as for as thought and conceptions are concerned it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515"></a>[515]</span>
probably the oldest portion of the whole book; but as
adapted by our author it implies, as we shall see later, an
historical situation prior to the destruction of Jerusalem
i.e. before, but not long before, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70. The Ezra Legend
in chapter xiv. belongs to the same period as the Salathiel
Apocalypse, viz. about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 100.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to examine the contents and teaching
of these Visions, and it will be best to take them in their
chronological order.</p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXII_V">V. <span class="smcap">The Vision of the Man rising from the Sea.</span></h4>

<p>This Vision is as follows<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>And it came to pass after seven days that I dreamed a dream by
night; and, behold, a wind arose from the sea, and it stirred up all
the waves thereof. And I looked, and behold [that wind caused
to arise up from the heart of the sea as it were the form of a man.
And I looked, and behold], that man flew with the clouds of Heaven;
and whithersoever he turned his face and looked, everything quaked
that was seen by him; and whithersoever the voice from his mouth
went, all that heard his voice melted away,<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> like as wax melteth
away when it feeleth the fire. And after this I looked, and behold,
a multitude of men, without number, from the four winds of Heaven,
were gathered together to war against the man who had arisen
from the sea. And I looked, and behold, he cut out for himself a
great mountain, and did fly upon it. But I sought to see the region
of the place <ins class="corr" id="tn-515" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'out of whch'">
out of which</ins> the mountain had been cut; but I could not.
And after this, I looked, and behold, all those who had gathered
together against him to make war upon him, feared greatly; nevertheless
they dared to fight. And behold, when he saw the onslaught
of the approaching multitude, he neither raised his hand, nor took
hold of spear or other warlike weapon; but I only saw how he sent
forth from his mouth as it were a fiery stream, and from his lips a
flaming breath, and from his tongue he shot forth a storm of sparks;
and all these were mixed together, the fiery stream and the flaming
breath and the mighty storm.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> And these fell upon the approaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516"></a>[516]</span>
multitude, ready to fight, and burned them all, so that suddenly
nothing was seen of the immense multitude but the dust of ashes
and the smell of smoke. And I looked, and was amazed. And after
this I saw that man coming down from the mountain and calling
unto himself another, a peaceful, multitude. And there drew unto
him the faces of many men, some of whom were glad, and some were
sorrowful, and some were bound, and some were leading others who
were to be offered.</p>
</div>

<p>The writer’s interpretation of this Vision with which the
rest of the chapter is taken up, is as follows: The man who
ascended from the sea and flew with the clouds of Heaven
is the Messiah; the innumerable multitude of men who
fight against him, and who are annihilated, are the nations
of the world; the great mountain which was cut out, and
concerning which the seer was in perplexity, is the heavenly
Jerusalem which came down from Heaven. The fiery
stream, and flaming breath, and storm of sparks represent
the fire of the Law whereby the enemies of the Messiah are
annihilated. The peaceful multitude which the Messiah
called unto himself are the ten tribes gathered out of the
lands of the Dispersion. Those who were glad and those
who were sorrowful are respectively Jews and Gentiles
coming to do homage to the Messiah. Those who were
bound were Jews who had been in captivity; while those
who were leading others to be offered, were the heathen
bringing Jews as an oblation to the Messiah, according to the
word of the prophet: “And they shall bring all your
brethren out of all the nations to be an oblation to Jehovah”
(Isa. lxvi. 20).</p>

<p>Stress must be laid upon the fact that between the Vision
itself and the writer’s explanation of it there are some incongruities;
this, as Box truly points out (<i>Op. cit.</i>, pp. 281 f.),
“is a common phenomenon in apocalyptic; the material
employed by the apocalyptists is often extremely old, and
has been derived by the apocalyptic writer from a tradition
which was already ancient when he wrote. The meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517"></a>[517]</span>
certain details in the fixed tradition which he uses is not
always clear to the apocalyptic writer himself. Hence the
lack of adjustment between certain features in the Vision
and the interpretation.... Thus, here the rising of the
man from the sea is explained (verse 52) as symbolical of the
mysterious origin of the Messiah (<em>My Son</em>), and the peaceable
multitude as the lost ten tribes. There are also features in the
interpretation which have nothing corresponding to them in
the Vision itself, viz., the internecine war of the nations before
they band themselves together against the Messiah (verses
31 f.), and the mention of the survivors who are found ‘within
my holy border,’ and whom the Messiah shall defend (verses
48, 49).... Thus the first point to be noted is that when
the Vision first assumed a written form, the real significance
of many features in the original Vision was already lost, and
was obscured by a more or less artificially adjusted interpretation.
In other words, religious thought and outlook
had long outgrown those of the fixed tradition. It had
become necessary to re-interpret the latter to suit later
conditions.” What the Vision and many of its curious details
really mean is an intricate, but very interesting, question;
we cannot, however, deal with this here, and must
direct those who desire further information on the subject
to the following works: Gunkel, <cite lang="de">Chaos und Schöpfung in

<h4 id="PII_CHXII_VI">VI. <span class="smcap">The Eagle Vision</span></h4>

<p>This Vision is too long to quote in full, but, put shortly,
its contents are as follows: In his vision the seer sees an
eagle ascending out of the sea, having twelve wings and three
heads. The eagle spreads her wings over all the earth, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518"></a>[518]</span>
the winds of heaven blow upon her. Out of her wings eight
smaller wings grow; but her heads remain at rest. The
middle head was greater than the others, “yet rested it
with them.” Then the eagle flew to reign over the earth, and
all the earth was subject unto her. And the seer heard the
eagle bid her wings not all to watch at once, but each in turn;
“but let the heads be kept until the end.” The voice which
the seer heard came not from the heads, but from the midst
of the eagle’s body. Then arose on the right side of the
eagle one wing which reigned over the earth, and then disappeared;
likewise a second wing arose, and reigned for
long, then disappeared; but concerning this second wing a
voice declared that after it none should reign even half as
long. All the wings in turn arose, reigned, and then appeared
no more. And now the seer sees the little wings
set up, on the right side, in order to reign; some ruled, but
disappeared almost at once, others rose up as though to rule,
but did not. Nothing remained now on the eagle’s body but
the three heads that rested, and six little wings. Two of
these latter divided themselves from the rest and remained
under the head that was upon the right side, the other four
remained where they were. Of these four one assayed to
reign, but quickly disappeared, then another vanished
even more quickly; before the other two could arise to reign
the middle head awoke and united itself to the other two
heads which it then devoured. This head then ruled over
all the earth with much oppression; but, like the wings, it,
too, suddenly disappeared. There remained, however, the
two heads, who also reigned over the earth; but presently
that on the right side devoured that on the left. “Then,”
the seer proceeds, “I heard a voice, which said unto me,
Look before thee, and consider the thing that thou seest.”
And he sees a lion which comes, roaring, out of a wood, and,
speaking with the voice of a man, upbraids the eagle for
her cruel oppression, and announces her approaching destruction, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519"></a>[519]</span>
saying: “Therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor
thy horrible wings, nor thy evil little wings, nor thy cruel
heads, nor thy hurtful talons, nor all thy worthless body;
that all the earth may be refreshed, being delivered from thy
violence, and may hope for judgement and mercy of him
that made her.” While the lion spoke thus with the eagle
the last head disappeared; and the two little wings which
had detached themselves and had gone over to it, arose and
sought to reign, but “their kingdom was small and full of
uproar,” and they soon disappeared. “Then the whole
body of the eagle was burned, so that the earth was in great
fear.”</p>

<p>Thus the Vision; then follows the interpretation. The
eagle who arose from the sea, he is told, “is the fourth
kingdom which appeared in vision to thy brother Daniel.”
In this kingdom twelve kings shall reign; these are represented
by the twelve wings. Of these kings the second shall
reign longer than any of the others. The eight smaller wings
represented eight kings “whose times shall be small, and
their years swift”; two of them shall perish when the
“middle time” of the kingdom comes, four shall be preserved
until the approach of the end, and two shall be kept until
the end. The interpretation of the three heads as given to
the seer is that in the last days of the kingdom the Most
High will raise up three kings, who will renew many things
in the kingdom, and bear tyrannous rule. “And whereas
thou sawest that the great head appeared no more, it signifieth
that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yet with
pain. But for the two that remained, the sword shall devour
them” (xii. 26, 27). The two wings that detached themselves
and went to the head on the right are reserved for the
end; for a short time they shall reign after the last head has
disappeared, but their reign shall be troublous. The voice
proceeding from “the midst of the body” means that “in
the midst of the time of that kingdom” there shall arise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520"></a>[520]</span>
“no small contentions, and it shall stand in peril of falling;
nevertheless it shall not then fall, but shall be restored
again to its first estate” (xii. 18). Finally, the lion is the
“anointed one,” i.e. the Messiah, Whom the Most High has
kept to the end of days.</p>

<p>The Vision represents history veiled in symbolical garb;
as in the Vision of the Man rising from the sea, the seer’s interpretation
does not always harmonize with the contents of
the Vision itself; this is to be accounted for by the fact that
a redactor made alterations in order to bring the Vision into
agreement with the course of history as viewed from his,
chronologically later, standpoint. As to the meaning of the
general historical outline of which the Vision treats most
scholars are agreed, but they differ as to details. The following
table shows, in the main, the bulk of learned opinion
(cp. Gunkel, <i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 345):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Eagle</i> = The Roman Empire, the eagle being the military emblem
of Rome.</p>

<p><i>The Sea</i> = The Mediterranean sea; the Roman Empire, “for the
Orientals, came up, as a matter of historical fact, from the sea,
and it is this fact which is doubtless in the apocalyptist’s
thought here” (Box).</p>

<p><i>The Twelve Wings</i> = Julius Cæsar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vindex, Nymphidius,
Piso. The second wing, mentioned in xi. 13-17, “which bare
rule a great time,” symbolizes Augustus, who reigned for over
fifty years.</p>

<p><i>The three heads</i> Vespasian, Titus, Domitian; the middle head
which is greater than the two others symbolizes Vespasian.</p>

<p><i>The eight smaller wings</i> = ?</p>

<p><i>The two little wings</i> (xi. 24) = Mucianus, proconsul of Syria, and
Tiberius Alexander, prefect of Egypt, according to Gunkel;
but he says that this interpretation is uncertain. These two
little wings are said to have remained under the head that was
upon the right side; this head symbolizes Domitian.</p>

<p><i>The two heads that remained</i> (xi. 34, 35) = Domitian and Titus, the
latter is said to have been murdered by the former.</p>
</div>

<p>That this interpretation is not in all points satisfactory
becomes clear as soon as it is studied in detail, and the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521"></a>[521]</span>
applies to other interpretations that have been offered; but
recently a new solution has been put forth by Box which
merits attention; we will give it in his own words (<i>Op. cit.</i>,
p. 265):</p>

<p>“It may be assumed that in the original form of the
vision<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> the three heads represent the three Flavian emperors;
the twelve wings represent the six Julian emperors from
Cæsar to Nero, reckoning the wings by pairs. The present
writer suggests that the reckoning by pairs in the original
vision was intended only to apply to the twelve wings, and
had a symbolical significance. The pairs served to emphasize
the greater dignity and power of the real emperors as contrasted
with the ephemeral rulers symbolized by the little
wings. In order to exaggerate the contrast the latter were
intended to be reckoned singly. The eight little wings
represent, in the original form of the vision, Vindex (March,
68), Nymphidius (a few months later)—these disappeared
about the same time as the last of the twelve wings (end of
Nero’s reign), as represented in our text (xi. 22). The
middle four represent Galba, Otho, Civitis (died June, 69),
and Vitellius (died Dec., 69). The two little wings that were
to survive the last head probably signify Roman governors
or generals who were expected to claim the imperial throne at
the last, or possibly the two last members of the Herodian
family, Agrippa II and Berenice.... In its original form,
then, the vision may date from the closing years of Domitian’s
reign (<i lang="la">circa</i> 95 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). But if the editor did not incorporate
it into his book—our Ezra-Apocalypse—till 120 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
or later (some time certainly in the reign of Hadrian), what,
it may well be asked, was the significance he himself attached
to the vision? He can no longer have identified the three
heads with the Flavian emperors, seeing that the reigns of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522"></a>[522]</span>
these had already long ended and the predicted deliverance
had not yet come.” Box holds that the Redactor identified
the three heads with Trajan, Hadrian and Lucius Quietus,
the last of these being a favourite of Trajan and regarded
as destined for the throne. Further, according to Box’s
interpretation, the Redactor put a new meaning on to the
“twelve wings,” these being symbolic of the six Julian
emperors, Galba, Otho and Vitellius, together with the
three Flavian emperors. There is much to be said in favour
of this hypothesis, though it will not be denied that some
difficulties still remain.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXII_VII">VII. <span class="smcap">The Salathiel Apocalypse</span></h4>

<p>This portion of our book, of which it forms the bulk, is of
a very different character from those already considered.
It consists of four Visions. We retain the term “Vision,”
as it is that usually adopted, but they are rather <em>Dialogues</em>;
the writer addresses God, but is answered by an angel. The
questions put by the former are prompted by moral difficulties
which trouble him; the answers are intended to solve
these difficulties.</p>

<p><i>The First Vision</i> (iii. 1-v. 19).</p>

<p>Salathiel, “the same is Esdras,” sees the desolation of
Sion, and the prosperity of Babylon. This incongruousness
between the adversity of God’s chosen people and the prosperity
of the godless Gentiles causes perplexity to the mind
of the seer, and prompts him “to speak words full of fear
to the Most High.” In the thoughts which follow it is
noticeable, first of all, that the writer expresses a sense of
sin which was deeper than that of the traditional Jewish
teaching on the subject. Hitherto the tendency had been
to regard transgressions solely from the point of view of
isolated acts; but here the conviction is implied that such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523"></a>[523]</span>
isolated sinful acts are symptomatic of something far worse
than temporary lapses would lead one to suppose; from
Adam onwards, it is now taught, the whole human race has
been steeped in sin; the existence not merely of sinful men
but of sinful humanity—the realization of this fact is what
plunges the writer into dark despair. Hence the sorrow and
suffering in the world: “For the first Adam, clothing himself
with a wicked heart, transgressed and was overcome;
and not he only, but all they also who were born of him.
Thus disease was made permanent” (iii. 21, 22); there is no
hope in this world. Then a further thought comes into the
writer’s mind; sin is everywhere prevalent, but how is it
that while Israel suffers for sin the Gentiles are in such prosperity?
Nay, more, is there any other nation that knows
God besides Israel? And yet Israel is not rewarded! Let
God, therefore, weigh the sins of each in the balance. All
men sin; yet assuredly Israel, if not better, is not worse
than the Gentiles; nevertheless, these prosper, but Israel
languishes. Then comes God’s answer, given by the angel
Uriel; it takes the form of calling upon the seer to do three
things:</p>

<p class="noindent pad4">
“Weigh me the weight of fire.”<br>
“Measure me the measure of the wind.”<br>
“Recall me the day that is past.”<br>
</p>

<p>But Esdras answers, who among the sons of man could do
such things! Then the angel says, if I had asked thee how
many dwellings there are in the heart of the sea, or how many
springs in the source of the deep, or how many ways
<ins class="corr" id="tn-523" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'above the firmanent'">
above the firmament</ins>, or where is the entrance to Hades, or the way
to Paradise—with reason thou wouldst have been unable
to say; but I have asked thee only concerning things within
thine own cognizance, and thou canst give me no answer!
Then the angel concludes: “Thine own things, that are
grown up with thee, canst thou not know; how then can thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a>[524]</span>
vessel [i.e. the body; containing the soul] comprehend the
way of the Most High” (iv. 10, 11). In other words, God’s
ways are inscrutable. This does not satisfy Esdras; so the
angel proceeds to show him how foolish it is for a mortal
man to wish to penetrate into the divine secrets; he would,
in any case, be unable to understand them; “he only that
dwelleth above the heavens may understand the things that
are above the height of the heavens” (iv. 21). To this
Esdras protests that it was not in his mind “to be curious
of the ways above,” but only concerning such things as he sees
daily before him. What he is unable to understand—and
here he reverts to his initial difficulty—is why Israel should
be afflicted, and in consequence the Law made of none effect.
Then he is told that a New Age is about to dawn upon the
world, and then all things will be made clear. On Esdras
asking when the New Age will come, and whether he will
still be on the earth then, the angel answers that he is
unable to tell; but he recounts the signs that are to precede
the end. These are given in v. 1-12; they are, in the main,
the traditional and stereotyped eschatological “signs.”
Thus ends the first Vision.</p>

<p><i>The Second Vision</i> (v. 21-vi. 34).</p>

<p>The subject-matter of this Vision is the same as that of the
preceding. Why does Israel suffer at the hand of oppressors?
The angel replies by again showing Esdras that the
ways of God cannot be comprehended by man, but that in
spite of what appears God’s love is for His people. The
seer then asks much about the coming of the End, and is told
that this will be brought about by God alone.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The Vision
concludes with a second enumeration of the signs of the End.</p>

<p><i>The Third Vision</i> (vi. 35-ix. 25).</p>

<p>Once more the problem which was the burden of the two
first Visions is reiterated, though put in a somewhat different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525"></a>[525]</span>
form: if the world was created for Israel’s sake, and if the
world is steeped in sin, why does Israel not enjoy his inheritance,
why is the world not subjected to Israel? “If the
world hath indeed been created for our sakes, why do we
not possess the world for our inheritance? How long shall
this endure?” (vi. 59). The angel tells Esdras that this
present world is but a narrow and dangerous entrance which
leads to the wide world which is to come; it was, indeed,
originally created for Israel, but through Adam’s sin it has
become a place of sorrow and suffering, and therefore the
righteous suffer with the wicked. There follows then (vii.
26-44) a long eschatological description which seems to
have fallen out of its place, it breaks the course of the argument
here. In the glorious world which is to come, it then
continues, only those will be worthy to partake of its joys
who have fulfilled the Law; but who has truly done so?
Who among mortals, whether Jew or Gentile, has not been
guilty of transgressing the divine Law? The angel answers
that there are some who are righteous, but they are comparatively
few; for them future joy is reserved. The rest
of mankind will perish. A long section then deals with the
subject of the state of the soul after death and before the
last Judgement. The righteous enter into bliss, but the
wicked are destined to suffer seven degrees of torment.
These descriptions, as Box truly remarks (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 141), are
“psychological in character, and apparently portray the
emotional experiences of the soul through which it passes
during the entire period of the intermediate state. In its
subtle delineation of the soul-life the whole section is
remarkable, and by the elevation and refinement of its
conceptions affords a striking contrast to similar descriptions
in other parts of the apocalyptic literature.”</p>

<p>It is then shown to the seer that there is no escape for
sinners, and he bitterly bewails the terrible fate hanging over
the mass of humanity. But the angel has no further comfort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526"></a>[526]</span>
to give than that there is more joy in heaven over the
salvation of the few than sorrow over the loss of the many.
Not unnaturally this reply does not satisfy the seer; he
cannot think that the divine mercy and love, which are so
lavishly displayed in the natural world around, should be
so restricted in regard to souls hereafter. The reply to his
question suggested by this thought, viz., that this world was
made for the many, but the next for few, is so discouraging
that he ceases to inquire concerning the human race as a
whole, and restricts himself to his own race, the Jewish.
But here again he is told that only the righteous, among
whom he is reckoned, can enjoy felicity hereafter; he is
bidden to refrain from further questionings regarding the
fate of the wicked; they have but themselves to thank for
their doom.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> The seer reiterates his former objection; to
this a final reply is given: All the sorrow and suffering of this
world is due to the sins of men; there was a time, before
men were created, when none spoke against God, or disobeyed
Him; but now men are evil, and have become
“corrupted in their manners” (ix. 19); only a grape from
the cluster, therefore, only a plant from the great forest, shall,
by God’s mercy, be saved. “Let the multitude perish then,
which has been born in vain; and let my grape be saved,
and my plant; for with great labour have I made them
perfect” (ix. 22).</p>

<p><i>The Fourth Vision</i> (ix. 26-x. 59).</p>

<p>This Vision begins with a soliloquy concerning the Law
which God gave to the fathers, but they did not observe it
any more than later generations did; Israel must, therefore,
perish; but the Law will abide in glory. In the same way,
the earthly Jerusalem must perish, but the heavenly Jerusalem
is eternal; upon this latter hope must be fixed, for it is
to be the joy of those blessed ones who shall gain a glorious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527"></a>[527]</span>
immortality in the world to come. The seer then recounts
a vision that he sees of a disconsolate woman who brought up
an only son, and he died on his wedding day. While the seer
speaks with this woman, he looks, and behold she vanishes,
and in her place “there was a city builded, and a place showed
itself of large foundations” (x. 27). The woman is the
heavenly Jerusalem, her son is the earthly Jerusalem. The
heavenly reality is thus manifested to the seer, and he is
bidden to go and see “the beauty and greatness of the
building.... For thou art blessed above many, and with
the Most High art called by name, like as but few” (x.
55-57).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In these Visions, then, it will have been noticed that the
problem which figures in some of the later Psalms, and in
the Book of Job, as to why the righteous suffer and the
wicked are in prosperity, is reiterated; the solution given
being that the righteous will come to their own when they
attain immortal life hereafter. The writer is deeply pessimistic
as far as this world is concerned; the universal prevalence
of sin which is ingrained in humanity through the
fall of Adam, and through which death, originally unnatural
to man, has come into the world, compels him to look upon
the ultimate fate of humanity as hopeless. Though an
ardent Jew, he sees but little hope even for himself or for
his own people; the divine Law itself is of no avail, for it
cannot be truly observed; “he despairs of a life of absolute
obedience to the Law, even by Israel, not to speak of the
world. The unconscious and unexpressed cry of the book
is for a moral dynamic, which legalism could not supply.”<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
There is, thus, an essential contradiction running through
these Visions; on the one hand, hope in the world to come,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528"></a>[528]</span>
on the other, hopelessness here and hereafter because all
mankind is irretrievably lost through sin. Nothing could
better illustrate those alternating emotions which incessantly
stir the human heart: the voice of Conscience, and trust
in the Divine Mercy. If our writer’s heart remains dark to
the end, it is because his true instinct concerning sin is not
balanced by an equally true conception of God. At first
sight it appears illogical that, in spite of all that the writer
has said, happiness hereafter should be declared to be
secured for a righteous remnant, among whom he himself
is included; the reason for this is, however, apparently
that God’s purpose in creating man for eternal life should not
be wholly frustrated.</p>

<p>In his eschatological teaching the writer of these Visions
departs from the older doctrines; “he does not look forward
to a restoration of the Jewish State, or a rebuilding of
Jerusalem; nor to a renewed and purified earth under the
conditions of the present world-order. His hopes are fixed
on the advent of the new and better world which will follow
the collapse of the present world. Consequently he anticipates
merely the catastrophic end of the present world-order—his
theology does not allow of any intermediate
Messianic Age. The new Jerusalem which is to come will
be the Heavenly City ... which belongs to the future
Age.”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>


<h4 id="PII_CHXII_VIII">VIII. <span class="smcap">An Ezra Legend</span></h4>

<p>In chapter xiv. occurs the legend of Ezra re-writing the
sacred books. It tells of how Ezra, while sitting under an
oak, heard the voice of God “out of a bush,” telling him
that he would soon be taken away from men. He is told to
set his house in order, to reprove his people, to comfort the
lowly, to instruct the wise, and to renounce the life that is
corruptible. Ezra expresses his readiness to do as commanded;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529"></a>[529]</span>
but he asks who there will be to admonish those
who are born after he is gone, for the world is in
darkness and God’s Law is burnt.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Then Ezra himself
proposes that he should re-write the Law “that men may
be able to find the path, and that they who would live in the
latter days may live” (xiv. 22). He is then commanded to
prepare many tablets and to take five men with him who
can write swiftly; “and when thou hast done, some things
shalt thou publish openly, and some things shalt thou
deliver in secret to the wise” (xiv. 26). Ezra does as he
is commanded after having asked for the divine spirit to
guide him; so that before he commences his work he is given
a cup to drink from, full of water, but the colour of it like
fire.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> When he had drunk from this cup his heart poured
forth understanding, and wisdom grew in his breast, and
his spirit retained its memory. For forty days he dictated,
and by the end of this time ninety-four books were written
by the five scribes. Then he is commanded by the Most
High to publish openly the first twenty-four books that had
been written, so that they might be read by the worthy and
the unworthy; but the last seventy he is told to keep in
order to deliver them to “such as be wise” among his people.
This Ezra does. Here the legend ends abruptly.</p>

<p>The twenty-four books refer to the canonical books of the
Bible, “the seventy secret books included, we may infer, not
only the book of <em>signs</em> and the secret (apocalyptic) tradition
associated with the name of Moses, but many other apocalyptic
books as well.... Thus, according to the representation
of our chapter, Ezra, i.e. the historical Ezra living
in Jerusalem in the middle of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, was the
restorer not only of the canonical books of the Old Testament,
but also of the large apocalyptic literature, including<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530"></a>[530]</span>
some apocalyptic books which detailed visions and revelations
that had, ostensibly, occurred to himself.... This amounts
to a claim that the apocalyptic tradition occupies an essential
place in genuine Judaism. It claims for itself the great
names of Moses and Ezra, ‘the second Moses.’”<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Box
suggests that the object of the publication of our book, and
of associating it with the name of Ezra, was to uphold, or to
re-assert, the authority of the apocalyptic literature, and
thus gain for it “an officially recognized place within Judaism
as part of the oral tradition.” That this was one of the
objects for which the book was published seems highly probable
when it is remembered that the Jewish religious
authorities rejected the apocalyptic literature as a whole<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>;
it was to be expected that the apocalyptists should make
strenuous efforts to secure the recognition of books which,
as they believed, recorded genuine tradition, and which in
any case taught much that was edifying.</p>

<p>Like the apocalyptic literature in general, this story of a
divine revelation accorded to Ezra to re-write all the sacred
books which had been destroyed, enjoyed considerable
recognition among the Church Fathers; it was known not
only as included in our book, but as an independent tradition.
For references to it in patristic writings see Bensly
and James, <i>Op. cit.</i>, pp. xxxvii. f.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Every reader of the Ezra-Apocalypse must, as he reads,
be very soon struck by the many reminiscences of Pauline
thought and teaching which it contains. But as the book is
later than almost all the books of the New Testament this
is not the place to deal with this important and fascinating
subject; to those who might wish to pursue the study of the
connection between 4 Esdras and Pauline teaching on such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531"></a>[531]</span>
doctrines as the Fall and Sin, the Law, Election, Justification
and Eschatology, etc., no better English book could be
recommended than Thackeray’s <cite>The Relation of St. Paul to
Contemporary Jewish Thought</cite> (1900).</p>

he overcame the generals of Darius. In 333 came the decisive
victory at Issus, when Darius himself was defeated. In 332 Alexander
marched victoriously down the coast of Syria. In 331 he
became master of Egypt; and later in the same year he inflicted
a crushing defeat again on Darius, taking Babylon and Susa. In
330 he continued his victories in Persia. During the next five
years he was occupied in the further east, fighting with invariable
success. He died suddenly in 323.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> It may be well to recall here the following facts; at the death
of Alexander in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 323 his empire was divided thus among his
generals: Antigonus obtained the provinces of Greater Phrygia,
Lycia, and Pamphylia; Seleucus, Babylonia; Ptolemy, Egypt;
Lysimachus, the Hellespont; and Cassander, Macedonia (cp. Josephus,
<cite>Antiq.</cite>, XII. i. 1). Incessant wars, however, went on among
these rulers. But in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 302 an alliance against Antigonus was
made, or rather renewed, by the four other kings; and in the following
year, as a result of the battle of Ipsus, the kingdom of Antigonus
(he, in common with the other rulers, had assumed the title
of king) came to a final end. The victorious allies divided his
kingdom among themselves thus: Seleucus got Syria proper;
Lysimachus, a large portion of Asia Minor; Cassander, Macedonia
and Greece; while to the Egyptian kingdom of Ptolemy was added
Cœle-Syria (not, however, without a protest from Seleucus), which
remained in the possession of the Ptolemys for a century; it was
finally conquered by Antiochus III (the Great), through his
victory at Panias (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 198), and it thus reverted to the Syrian
kingdom.</p>

Sadducees (<em>Zaddūkim</em>) takes its origin from the personal name Zadok.
One is that the double <em>d</em> in <em>Zaddūkim</em> does not permit of its being
derived from Zadok with only one; this objection would be serious
were it not that in the Septuagint and in Josephus Zadok is spelled
with two d’s. This objection, therefore, falls to the ground. The
other is that there is nothing to show that the Sadducees were ever
regarded as the sons of Zadok, nor that they themselves made such a
claim. This <i lang="la">argumentum e silentio</i>, always precarious, is upset by
the evidence of the <cite>Zadokite Fragments</cite>. Hölscher’s contention
(<i>Op. cit.</i>, pp. 102 ff.) that the term “sons of Zadok” was one of
reproach does not appear to us to be necessary.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_179" href="#FNanchor_179" class="label">[179]</a> Lauterbach (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 186 f.) would explain the matter a
little differently, though the final result is much the same; he says
that the Sadducees “laid down their own decisions and rules in a
book called ‘Book of Decrees’ or ‘Decisions’ to guide them in
deciding questions to which no answer could be found in the Mosaic
Code. They did not deem it right or necessary to invent new rules
of hermeneutics, or to develop methods of interpretation to enable
them to force their laws and decisions into the meaning of the words
of the Torah, so as to pass off their own rules and decisions as part
of, or derived from, a Mosaic law, thus making them of equal authority
with, and of the same binding character as, the written Law.
For, in their opinion, no other laws could ever acquire the authority
of the Laws of the Torah.... The Sadducees distinguished strictly
between the absolutely binding written laws and their additional
laws and decisions. The latter ... were authoritative only as
long as they were considered necessary or feasible by the leaders
and rulers of the community. For the same reason, they did not
consider the decisions and practices instituted by their predecessors,
the priests and teachers of former generations, which constituted
the <em>traditional laws</em>, of absolute authority like the written Law.
Hence their peculiar attitude towards the traditional Law, and
their objection to its authority. They did not deny the existence
of these old traditional laws, for they themselves were the possessors
and transmitters of the same. Nor did they reject them as spurious
or as without any authority, for they recognized the right of former
priests and teachers to enact such laws. They only refused to
consider these traditional laws as of authority absolute and equal
with the written Law contained in the Torah.” The result, therefore,
so far as their controversy with the Pharisees on this point
was concerned, was the same: traditional laws, by whomsoever
put forth, whether based on the written Law or not, were not permanently
binding nor of equal authority with the written Law;
the Pharisees, on the other, since they contended that the oral
Law was based upon the written Law, regarded both as of equal
authority and permanently binding.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> There is an important passage in Ecclesiasticus (xlv. 23-25,
Hebr.) which must be referred to here; in this passage Phinehas is
set beside Moses and Aaron as “the third ... and he made atonement
for the children of Israel. Therefore for him too, He [i.e.
God] established an ordinance, a covenant of peace to maintain
the sanctuary; that to him and to his seed should appertain the
High-priesthood for ever.” Then reference is made to David and to
Aaron; the mention of these here in a chronological list of Israel’s great
ones is quite out of place, and therefore there must be some special
purpose in referring to them; that purpose is plain enough, for in
speaking of David it is said that “the inheritance of the king
is his son’s alone,” while in speaking of Aaron it is said that “the
inheritance of Aaron belongs to his seed.” A differentiation is thus
made between the royal line and the priestly line; and as the royal
line had ceased, and only the priestly one continued, and the High-priest
(the descendant of the house of Zadok) was both ecclesiastical
and political leader, it was from this line that the Messiah would be
expected to come. In Ecclesiasticus (see <a href="#Page_334">pp. 334</a> ff.) the Sadducæan
standpoint is represented. See also 1 Maccabees ii. 54, “Phinehas
our father ... obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood”
(cp. 4 Macc. xviii. 12).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="label">[199]</a> With the Greek word <em>Kanôn</em> (Canon) compare the Hebrew
<em>qāneh</em>, a “reed,” which is also used in the sense of a “measuring
rod” (Ezek. xlii. 16-19; cp. Judith xiii. 6, where the Greek word is
used for the “rail” of a bed). Originally the word in Greek meant
a “carpenter’s rule,” and had nothing to do with the books of Scripture.
In its technical sense it is Christian, being thus used for the
first time, so far as is known, about the middle of the fourth century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; the fifty-ninth canon of the council of Laodicæa (about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
360) speaks of “canonical books” as opposed to uncanonical. It
is a still later usage, so far as our present knowledge goes, which
applies the term Canon to the whole collection of biblical books.
What the original idea was in using the expression in reference to
the books of the Bible is uncertain, but probably it was that of
“norm” or “rule” (cp. Gal. vi. 16; 2 Cor. x. 13); just as “canonical
action” (1 Ep. of Clement vii. 2) was according to the Christian
norm, so books judged by their contents, authorship, and history,
were declared to be according to the Christian norm, and therefore
“canonical”; cp. the expressions “rule (or canon) of truth,”
“rule (or canon) of faith,” used in the early Church. It is probable
that the adjective “canonical” preceded the use of the noun
“Canon” in its technical sense.</p>

p. 119). And again (p. 121): “These writings, which are so well
known to us, were probably only samples, though doubtless the
choicest ones, of an abundant literature to which every Jew at the
end of the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> had access.” On the other hand, Ryle
believes that by about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200 there was a definitely recognized

<p><a id="Footnote_334" href="#FNanchor_334" class="label">[334]</a> In one passage in this Vision, xii. 34, the Messianic Kingdom

<p><a id="Footnote_335" href="#FNanchor_335" class="label">[335]</a> The whole passage, iii. 1-9, deals with the lot of the righteous

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_336" href="#FNanchor_336" class="label">[336]</a> “Behold, the Lord God will come as a mighty one and His arm
shall rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense
before Him” (Isa. xl. 10). “And the Lord will create over
the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a
cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night;
for over all the glory shall be spread a canopy. And there shall be
a pavilion for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a
refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain” (Isa. iv. 5, 6).
“In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and
for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of His people, and for a
spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement, and for strength
to them that turn back the battle at the gate” (Isa. xxviii. 5, 6).
It is the thought, not the language, which shows connection between
the two; in the Septuagint of Isaiah xxviii. 5, for example, “a diadem
of beauty” is differently expressed, but see Isaiah lxii. 3 (Sept.).
“And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him,
and His righteousness it upheld Him. And He put on righteousness
as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon His head; and He
put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal
as a cloke” (Isa. lix. 16, 17). Cp. also parts of Psalm xviii.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_357" href="#FNanchor_357" class="label">[357]</a> In this connection it is important to note the following facts:
<em>all</em> the Greek manuscripts, uncial as well as cursives, have a great
displacement in the text, xxx. 25-xxxiii. 13<i>a</i> having exchanged
places with xxxiii. 13<i>b</i>-xxxvi. 16<i>a</i>; since all the Greek manuscripts
have this displacement it is obvious that all ultimately go back to a
single parent manuscript; now the Old Latin Version has <em>not</em> got
the displacement, and yet it is a translation from the Greek; consequently
this version represents a condition of affairs which is older
than the oldest Greek manuscripts.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_392" href="#FNanchor_392" class="label">[392]</a> Origen, <cite>Ep. ad Afric.</cite>, xiii., says that the book was not written
in Hebrew; Jerome, <cite lang="la">Praef. in Vers. libri Tob.</cite>, says he translated it
from the Chaldee (i.e. Aramaic), but this was itself a translation,
for while the Greek puts the narrative from i. 3-iii. 6 in the first
person and from here onwards continues in the third person, Jerome’s
Aramaic (which is in all probability represented by the manuscript
edited by Neubauer, <cite>The Book of Tobit, A Chaldee text</cite> ... 1878)
makes the <em>whole</em> narrative run in the third person; but if the original
form of the story was written in the third person throughout, it is unthinkable
that in a later form the first person would have been
substituted in i. 3-iii. 6 alone. On the other hand, it would be quite
natural for the original writer to commence his story in the first person
and later to fall into the third person, for this latter is the simpler
and easier form of narration. The Hebrew Versions are of quite
late date, and obviously translations; see Neubauer, <i>Op. cit.</i>, and
Gaster, <cite>Two Unknown Hebrew Versions of the Tobit Legend</cite> (1897).</p>

praise of truth being an addition. The whole seems to have been
originally written in Greek, and shows affinity with the epistle of
Aristeas (Ewald, <cite>Hist.</cite>, v. 165); the writer appears to have knowledge
of the court history of Persia (iv. 29 ff.). The hero of the story is
